Anything?\r\n\r\nResearch tells us at least 70% of the people who find your site, after a quick once-over, they disappear… forever.\r\n\r\nThat means that all the work and effort you put into getting them to show up, goes down the tubes.\r\n\r\nWhy would you want all that good work – and the great site you’ve built – go to waste?\r\n\r\nBecause the odds are they’ll just skip over calling or even grabbing their phone, leaving you high and dry.\r\n\r\nBut here’s a thought… what if you could make it super-simple for someone to raise their hand, say, “okay, let’s talk” without requiring them to even pull their cell phone from their pocket?\r\n  \r\nYou can – thanks to revolutionary new software that can literally make that first call happen NOW.\r\n\r\nTalk With Web Visitor is a software widget that sits on your site, ready and waiting to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number.

We walk through the snowy passes over 5000 m, go across the turquoise waters of Lake Phoksunmdo and immerse ourselves in the spiritual heart of Upper Dolpo and discover Shey and Taksang. We follow the ancient paths of yak caravans carrying salt to Tibet. En route we come across beautiful monasteries and villages that cling to the mountains. The sight of colorful prayer flags fluttering in the breeze remain ingrained our minds forever. The ever smiling faces of the Dolpopas, the original inhabitants of this unique kingdom, make the encounter with them an experience of a lifetime.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\r\n','<p>Nepalese Visa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nepalese visa can be obtained at the Nepalese Embassy, Consulates or Missions abroad or at the immigration counter at the port of entry in Nepal. Multiple entry tourist visas are issued for a period valid for 15 days at US$ 25, 30 days for US$ 40 and 90 days for US$ 100 per person. You will require two passport size photos to acquire the visa.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Documentation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the visa you will require 2 different kinds of permits for this trek &ndash; Upper Dolpo Restricted Area Permit and Shey Phoksundo National Park Permit. Please carry 8 passport size photos for the permits. We will help you acquire your permit in Kathmandu. Please note that the permit fees are already included in your cost. &nbsp;We suggest you leave your passport and your international air tickets with us here in Kathmandu. We will reconfirm your air tickets before your international departure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepalese time</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal time is ahead by 5h45 than international GMT.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During winter if it is 12h00 in France it is 16h45 in N&eacute;pal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During summer it if is 12h00 in France it is 15h45 in N&eacute;pal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food on the trek</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For camping trek our mobile kitchen crew serves Nepalese, Indian and Continental fare during camping treks. Bread, butter and jam with eggs are usually served for breakfast which is occasionally accompanied by muesli, granola and porridge. Hot chocolate, coffee, tea and juice are served. The crew could surprise you with cakes, pies and pizza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Support staff</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All our Tour Leaders have undergone leadership training and have had intensive courses on mountain medicine, first aid and are capable of handling emergency situations. They are deep understanding and knowledge of the mountain culture and are familiar with high altitude survival skills. Our support crew (except the porters) are usually sherpas who have been the backbone of the trekking industry in Nepal and the team usually has years of experience between them and so our team is prepared for all eventualities in the mountains. &nbsp;The preservation of the fragile Eco system is of utmost importance to us and our support staff is made well aware of the significance of preserving the environment. We conduct regular orientation programs to educate our support crew regarding the importance of conservation of our environment. We take pride in the high quality of service we render &ndash; personalized, professional and above all enjoyable. Our crew with a keen sense of hospitality will make your holiday worthwhile. You will make friends with our tour leader during the trip and find adventure that you will re-live the rest of your life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best Season</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most appropriate time to visit Upper Dolpo is between May &ndash; September. The sky is clear and the climate is mild with temperatures suitable for travel. &nbsp;Since Upper Dolpo lies in the rain shadow area it is unaffected by the monsoons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trek Equipment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For camping treks we provide state of the art equipment that comprises of two men North Face Tents, Mess tent, Kitchen tent, Toilet tent, Shower tents, folding chairs, tables, cooking utensils, fuel (kerosene or LPG), all cooking appliances, mattresses, shower pumps, folding toilet seats and gamow bags in case of high altitude treks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transportation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driving is on the left in Nepal but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. Comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photography</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole world uses digital photography these days. The sunlight is very bright during the daytime due to the thin air so please take that into account while filming. Not all of the monasteries and places of interest are open for filming. Some places levy a small amount for every picture taken while in some places it is strictly prohibited so it is advisable to seek the advice of your guide before you take a photo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Group size</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The size of the group could vary from 2 - 16 people. Though we can manage larger groups due to group dynamics we only operate groups up to 16 people. We have limited number of people in all our departures to ensure personalized service. We try and make sure that the need of each and every client is attended to and he/she feels comfortable and can enjoy the amazing culture, landscape and people better and have a great holiday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responsible Tourism</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile. Responsible and sustainable tourism has always been our main thrust and mantra so that the environment and its resources- natural or cultural &ndash; always remain intact for the future generations to savor. We strongly advise that all non-biodegradable items such as can, bottles, batteries, plastics etc to be brought back to Kathmandu for proper disposition. We discourage the use of bottled mineral water to control the plastic bottles&#39; waste. Since water is essential while traveling at such high altitudes we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers. As a part of our responsible tourism drive we use local guides and locally owned hotels (wherever possible) so that the people can earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Packing List</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weather in Nepal can vary significantly, and the best advice is to take clothing that will layer to cover all eventualities.

So take care in what you eat or drink. Travelling in Nepal does not involve major health risks provided simple precautions are observed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Drink bottled water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually unpasteurized</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential to avoid illnesses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Altitude sickness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes travelers face health hazards mainly due to the high altitude. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Loss of appetite</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Fatigue</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Headache</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Nausea</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Dizziness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Palpitations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Sleeplessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Breathlessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaccination</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Physical fitness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare yourself by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical Facilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance. You will need to leave your insurance details in our office in Kathmandu during the trip so that we can make necessary arrangements should the need arise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk and Liability&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times. However sometimes unforeseen circumstances like landslides, floods, bad weather, bad road condition, vehicle breakdown, delay in flights due to bad weather, local political situation could contribute to the change in the program. No claim of refund will be entertained including early return from the trip, or change in itinerary due to unavoidable situations like the above. All extra expenses (apart from the services offered as per the program) that occur in such cases would have to borne directly by the clients themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n','<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th><span style=\"color:#696969\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\">Days &nbsp;

(17,'MANASLU CIRCUIT ','OFF THE BEATEN PATH INTO THE  HEART OF THE HIMALAYAS ','manaslu-circuit1','[\"80\"]','manaslu-circuit1492488512.jpg','15 ','1315',5,'','','','<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#696969\"><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">We trek right into the heart of the Manaslu and discover authentic Nepal. We trek through lush paddy fields and reach the base camp of one of the giants of the planet Manaslu that stands tall at 8163 meters. The Manaslu region offers contrasting landscapes rich in flora and fauna on off the beaten trails through wild forests with the Himlayan giants keeping us constant company. We cross the suspension bridge over the Buri Gandaki river and trek to the high glacial valleys that provide breathtaking views of Manaslu (8163m), Himalchuli (7893m) and West Peak (7540m). Past the village of Lihi we enter into a wild unfrequented area inhabited by people of Tibetan descent. We then ascend to the Manaslu Base Camp (4 800m) and traverse the Larkya La Pass at 5 160m which is the highlight of our trip. The trek offers us glimpses of legendary peaks, forgotten villages and ancient monasteries and provides a different experience of the Himalayas!</span></span></span></p>\r\n','<p>Nepalese Visa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nepalese visa can be obtained at the Nepalese Embassy, Consulates or Missions abroad or at the immigration counter at the port of entry in Nepal.

Normally all three meals are included in the price along with tea or coffee and biscuits when you arrive in the lodge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Support staff</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All our Tour Leaders have undergone leadership training and have had intensive courses on mountain medicine, first aid and are capable of handling emergency situations. They are deep understanding and knowledge of the mountain culture and are familiar with high altitude survival skills. Our support crew (except the porters) are usually sherpas who have been the backbone of the trekking industry in Nepal and the team usually has years of experience between them and so our team is prepared for all eventualities in the mountains. &nbsp;The preservation of the fragile Eco system is of utmost importance to us and our support staff is made well aware of the significance of preserving the environment. We conduct regular orientation programs to educate our support crew regarding the importance of conservation of our environment. We take pride in the high quality of service we render &ndash; personalized, professional and above all enjoyable. Our crew with a keen sense of hospitality will make your holiday worthwhile. You will make friends with our tour leader during the trip and find adventure that you will re-live the rest of your life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best Season</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is best to visit this region in spring and autumn.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Spring generally begins in March and ends in May. Though there is a slight haze the forests covered with a riot of scarlet coloured rhododendrons, primulas, daisies, white magnolias and a host of other beautiful plants making a trek an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Mid September heralds the beginning of the autumn season. Mid September to mid November enjoys excellent climate coupled with deep blue sky and clear days making this period the best trekking period of the year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transportation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driving is on the left in Nepal but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. Comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photography</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole world uses digital photography these days. The sunlight is very bright during the daytime due to the thin air so please take that into account while filming. Not all of the monasteries and places of interest are open for filming. Some places levy a small amount for every picture taken while in some places it is strictly prohibited so it is advisable to seek the advice of your guide before you take a photo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Group size</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The size of the group could vary from 2 - 16 people. Though we can manage larger groups due to group dynamics we only operate groups up to 16 people. We have limited number of people in all our departures to ensure personalized service. We try and make sure that the need of each and every client is attended to and he/she feels comfortable and can enjoy the amazing culture, landscape and people better and have a great holiday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responsible Tourism</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile. Responsible and sustainable tourism has always been our main thrust and mantra so that the environment and its resources- natural or cultural &ndash; always remain intact for the future generations to savor. We strongly advise that all non-biodegradable items such as can, bottles, batteries, plastics etc to be brought back to Kathmandu for proper disposition. We discourage the use of bottled mineral water to control the plastic bottles&#39; waste. Since water is essential while traveling at such high altitudes we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers. As a part of our responsible tourism drive we use local guides and locally owned hotels (wherever possible) so that the people can earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Packing List</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weather in Nepal can vary significantly, and the best advice is to take clothing that will layer to cover all eventualities.

So take care in what you eat or drink. Travelling in Nepal does not involve major health risks provided simple precautions are observed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Drink bottled water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually unpasteurized</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential to avoid illnesses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Altitude sickness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes travelers face health hazards mainly due to the high altitude. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Loss of appetite</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Fatigue</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Headache</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Nausea</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Dizziness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Palpitations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Sleeplessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Breathlessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaccination</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Physical fitness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare yourself by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical Facilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance. You will need to leave your insurance details in our office in Kathmandu during the trip so that we can make necessary arrangements should the need arise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk and Liability&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times. However sometimes unforeseen circumstances like landslides, floods, bad weather, bad road condition, vehicle breakdown, delay in flights due to bad weather, local political situation could contribute to the change in the program. No claim of refund will be entertained including early return from the trip, or change in itinerary due to unavoidable situations like the above. All extra expenses (apart from the services offered as per the program) that occur in such cases would have to borne directly by the clients themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n','<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#696969\">Days &nbsp;

Lost Monasteries, high wild mountain trails, remote villages offer a unique immersion into the vastness and diversity of the Nepalese Himalayas. It is a unique adventure that leads us into the heart of less frequented Manaslu region. We follow the trail to the remote Tsum Valley and then to the base camp of Ganesh Himal. The circuit passes through beautiful Gurung villages set against the backdrop of lush green landscapes. Unspoiled and far from the trappings of modern life the TsumValley preserves its Tibetan influences and ancient culture. The serenity of these isolated places with scattered shelters of yak herders allows us to experience a true wild and untamed Nepal long forgotten. We continue our trek to the sacred mountains of Ganesh Himal. On our return leg we follow the totally isolated trails of Manaslu via Rupina La Pass which offers exceptional views of Manaslu Himal. This off the beaten path trip takes us deep into the heart of Nepal&rsquo;s secret summits and reveals new facets of the Himalayas.</span></span></span></p>\r\n','<p>Nepalese Visa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nepalese visa can be obtained at the Nepalese Embassy, Consulates or Missions abroad or at the immigration counter at the port of entry in Nepal.

Though there is a slight haze the forests covered with a riot of scarlet coloured rhododendrons, primulas, daisies, white magnolias and a host of other beautiful plants making a trek an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Mid September heralds the beginning of the autumn season. Mid September to mid November enjoys excellent climate coupled with deep blue sky and clear days making this period the best trekking period of the year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trek Equipment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For camping treks we provide state of the art equipment that comprises of two men North Face Tents, Mess tent, Kitchen tent, Toilet tent, Shower tents, folding chairs, tables, cooking utensils, fuel (kerosene or LPG), all cooking appliances, mattresses, shower pumps, folding toilet seats and gamow bags in case of high altitude treks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transportation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driving is on the left in Nepal but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. Comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photography</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole world uses digital photography these days. The sunlight is very bright during the daytime due to the thin air so please take that into account while filming. Not all of the monasteries and places of interest are open for filming. Some places levy a small amount for every picture taken while in some places it is strictly prohibited so it is advisable to seek the advice of your guide before you take a photo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Group size</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The size of the group could vary from 2 - 16 people. Though we can manage larger groups due to group dynamics we only operate groups up to 16 people. We have limited number of people in all our departures to ensure personalized service. We try and make sure that the need of each and every client is attended to and he/she feels comfortable and can enjoy the amazing culture, landscape and people better and have a great holiday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responsible Tourism</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile. Responsible and sustainable tourism has always been our main thrust and mantra so that the environment and its resources- natural or cultural &ndash; always remain intact for the future generations to savor. We strongly advise that all non-biodegradable items such as can, bottles, batteries, plastics etc to be brought back to Kathmandu for proper disposition. We discourage the use of bottled mineral water to control the plastic bottles&#39; waste. Since water is essential while traveling at such high altitudes we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers. As a part of our responsible tourism drive we use local guides and locally owned hotels (wherever possible) so that the people can earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Packing List</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weather in Nepal can vary significantly, and the best advice is to take clothing that will layer to cover all eventualities.

Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Loss of appetite</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Fatigue</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Headache</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Nausea</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Dizziness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Palpitations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Sleeplessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Breathlessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaccination</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Physical fitness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare yourself by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical Facilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance. You will need to leave your insurance details in our office in Kathmandu during the trip so that we can make necessary arrangements should the need arise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk and Liability&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times. However sometimes unforeseen circumstances like landslides, floods, bad weather, bad road condition, vehicle breakdown, delay in flights due to bad weather, local political situation could contribute to the change in the program.

It offers spellbinding view of mountain peaks, herds of yaks and forgotten monasteries along the trail. The closest trekking area from Kathmandu, the region offers you a unique Himalayan cultural experience. You walk across the high glacial valley of Langtang and come across villages inhabited by Tamangs and Sherpas. The trail is dotted with small gompas and you are greeted by trains of yak caravans, prayer flags fluttering in the breeze as you head up to Kyanjing Ri (4984m) where you soak in the breathtaking scenery under the gaze of Shishapangma (8013m). You continue your journey to Gosainkund Lake, which is replete with stories and mountain legends.&nbsp; A captivating and wild trek that offers beautiful views mountain vistas.</span></span></span></p>\r\n','<p>Nepalese Visa<br />\r\nThe Nepalese visa can be obtained at the Nepalese Embassy, Consulates or Missions abroad or at the immigration counter at the port of entry in Nepal.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMultiple entry tourist visas are issued for a period valid for 15 days at US$ 25, 30 days for US$ 40 and 90 days for US$ 100 per person.

Normally all three meals are included in the price along with tea or coffee and biscuits when you arrive in the lodge.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSupport staff<br />\r\nAll our Tour Leaders have undergone leadership training and have had intensive courses on mountain medicine, first aid and are capable of handling emergency situations. They are deep understanding and knowledge of the mountain culture and are familiar with high altitude survival skills. Our support crew (except the porters) are usually sherpas who have been the backbone of the trekking industry in Nepal and the team usually has years of experience between them and so our team is prepared for all eventualities in the mountains.&nbsp; The preservation of the fragile Eco system is of utmost importance to us and our support staff is made well aware of the significance of preserving the environment. We conduct regular orientation programs to educate our support crew regarding the importance of conservation of our environment. We take pride in the high quality of service we render &ndash; personalized, professional and above all enjoyable. Our crew with a keen sense of hospitality will make your holiday worthwhile. You will make friends with our tour leader during the trip and find adventure that you will re-live the rest of your life.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBest Season<br />\r\nIt is best to visit this region in spring and autumn.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Spring generally begins in March and ends in May. Though there is a slight haze the forests covered with a riot of scarlet coloured rhododendrons, primulas, daisies, white magnolias and a host of other beautiful plants making a trek an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mid September heralds the beginning of the autumn season. Mid September to mid November enjoys excellent climate coupled with deep blue sky and clear days making this period the best trekking period of the year.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTransportation<br />\r\nDriving is on the left in Nepal but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. Comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhotography<br />\r\nThe whole world uses digital photography these days. The sunlight is very bright during the daytime due to the thin air so please take that into account while filming. Not all of the monasteries and places of interest are open for filming. Some places levy a small amount for every picture taken while in some places it is strictly prohibited so it is advisable to seek the advice of your guide before you take a photo.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGroup size<br />\r\nThe size of the group could vary from 2 - 16 people. Though we can manage larger groups due to group dynamics we only operate groups up to 16 people. We have limited number of people in all our departures to ensure personalized service. We try and make sure that the need of each and every client is attended to and he/she feels comfortable and can enjoy the amazing culture, landscape and people better and have a great holiday.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nResponsible Tourism<br />\r\nThe ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile. Responsible and sustainable tourism has always been our main thrust and mantra so that the environment and its resources- natural or cultural &ndash; always remain intact for the future generations to savor. We strongly advise that all non-biodegradable items such as can, bottles, batteries, plastics etc to be brought back to Kathmandu for proper disposition. We discourage the use of bottled mineral water to control the plastic bottles&#39; waste. Since water is essential while traveling at such high altitudes we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers. As a part of our responsible tourism drive we use local guides and locally owned hotels (wherever possible) so that the people can earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPacking List<br />\r\nThe weather in Nepal can vary significantly, and the best advice is to take clothing that will layer to cover all eventualities. It may easily be cold in the evenings and when walking at higher altitudes.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Clothing and Footwear<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Warm down jacket for the cold&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Warm clothes&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Spare clothing - several thinner layers are better than one thick layer&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Walking boots - well worn-in, with good ankle support and strong ridged soles with good tread, and spare boot laces<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Trekking boots - Windproof/waterproof trousers and jacket with hood, good rain gear: It is quite likely to rain at some point whilst you are out.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sun protection: sunglasses with UV protection<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Loop-pile socks - one thick and one thin pair reduces the risk of blisters<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Long trousers and long-sleeved shirts to provide protection from the sun&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sun hat - although it is unlikely to be too hot, the sun may be very strong<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Comfortable clothes - for evenings and comfortable shoes for sightseeing&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lightweight survival bag - A small rucksack - a bin liner will keep contents dry if it rains<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Balaclava/ warm Cap - Scarf/ mask<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Windbreakers/ Jacket&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Down Sleeping bag&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Towel - if you intend to go swimming and for use on the trek (bath towels are of course supplied in hotels)&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Torch - essential as not everywhere has electricity and the mains supply can be erratic<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Adapter - sockets may be large or small, 3 round pin or 2 round pin.

So take care in what you eat or drink. Travelling in Nepal does not involve major health risks provided simple precautions are observed.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Drink bottled water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually unpasteurized<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential to avoid illnesses.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAltitude sickness<br />\r\nSometimes travelers face health hazards mainly due to the high altitude. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Loss of appetite<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fatigue<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Headache<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nausea<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dizziness<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Palpitations<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sleeplessness<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Breathlessness<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVaccination<br />\r\nImmunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhysical fitness<br />\r\nSince the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare yourself by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMedical Facilities<br />\r\nThere are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInsurance<br />\r\nInsurance All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance. You will need to leave your insurance details in our office in Kathmandu during the trip so that we can make necessary arrangements should the need arise.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRisk and Liability&nbsp;<br />\r\nOur trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times. However sometimes unforeseen circumstances like landslides, floods, bad weather, bad road condition, vehicle breakdown, delay in flights due to bad weather, local political situation could contribute to the change in the program.

It takes up to the famous Annapurna region. We cross the Thorong La (5416 m) and trek to the heart of the Annapurnas as we make our way to the Annpurna Sanctuary. We are greeted by amazing views of the mountains and glacial lakes. It is a unique trek that offers a diverse experience as it showcases that best of what Nepal has to offer in terms of landscape; picturesque scenery; culture; people. We pass stark arid high altitude deserts dotted by monasteries, Gurung villages scattered among lush paddy fields against the backdrop of some of the highest mountains in the world. We walk in the footsteps of Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenel who first conquered an 8000 meter peak when they stood on top of Annapurna. It is a mythical trek in the footsteps of the first conquest of the Himalayas.</span></span></span></p>\r\n','<p>Nepalese Visa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nepalese visa can be obtained at the Nepalese Embassy, Consulates or Missions abroad or at the immigration counter at the port of entry in Nepal.

Normally all three meals are included in the price along with tea or coffee and biscuits when you arrive in the lodge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Support staff</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All our Tour Leaders have undergone leadership training and have had intensive courses on mountain medicine, first aid and are capable of handling emergency situations. They are deep understanding and knowledge of the mountain culture and are familiar with high altitude survival skills. Our support crew (except the porters) are usually sherpas who have been the backbone of the trekking industry in Nepal and the team usually has years of experience between them and so our team is prepared for all eventualities in the mountains. &nbsp;The preservation of the fragile Eco system is of utmost importance to us and our support staff is made well aware of the significance of preserving the environment. We conduct regular orientation programs to educate our support crew regarding the importance of conservation of our environment.

You will make friends with our tour leader during the trip and find adventure that you will re-live the rest of your life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best Season</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is best to visit this region in spring and autumn.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Spring generally begins in March and ends in May. Though there is a slight haze the forests covered with a riot of scarlet coloured rhododendrons, primulas, daisies, white magnolias and a host of other beautiful plants making a trek an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Mid September heralds the beginning of the autumn season. Mid September to mid November enjoys excellent climate coupled with deep blue sky and clear days making this period the best trekking period of the year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transportation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driving is on the left in Nepal but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. Comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photography</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole world uses digital photography these days. The sunlight is very bright during the daytime due to the thin air so please take that into account while filming. Not all of the monasteries and places of interest are open for filming. Some places levy a small amount for every picture taken while in some places it is strictly prohibited so it is advisable to seek the advice of your guide before you take a photo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Group size</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The size of the group could vary from 2 - 16 people. Though we can manage larger groups due to group dynamics we only operate groups up to 16 people. We have limited number of people in all our departures to ensure personalized service. We try and make sure that the need of each and every client is attended to and he/she feels comfortable and can enjoy the amazing culture, landscape and people better and have a great holiday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responsible Tourism</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile. Responsible and sustainable tourism has always been our main thrust and mantra so that the environment and its resources- natural or cultural &ndash; always remain intact for the future generations to savor. We strongly advise that all non-biodegradable items such as can, bottles, batteries, plastics etc to be brought back to Kathmandu for proper disposition. We discourage the use of bottled mineral water to control the plastic bottles&#39; waste. Since water is essential while traveling at such high altitudes we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers. As a part of our responsible tourism drive we use local guides and locally owned hotels (wherever possible) so that the people can earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Packing list</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weather in Nepal can vary significantly, and the best advice is to take clothing that will layer to cover all eventualities.

Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Loss of appetite</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Fatigue</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Headache</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Nausea</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Dizziness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Palpitations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Sleeplessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Breathlessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaccination</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Physical fitness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare yourself by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical Facilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance. You will need to leave your insurance details in our office in Kathmandu during the trip so that we can make necessary arrangements should the need arise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk and Liability&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times.

All extra expenses (apart from the services offered as per the program) that occur in such cases would have to borne directly by the clients themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n','<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>\r\n			<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n			<p><span style=\"color:#696969\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Days &nbsp;

The trail starts at a low elevation past green rice fields, quaint little villages and then ascends to dizzying heights. We visit the wild Naar Phu valley and then climb Chulu Far East. The trek passes through Tilicho Lake, a high altitude natural lake set amidst amazing scenery. The trail passes through the well preserved and grandiose Naar Phu valley which was opened to trekkers only in 2003. The trip offers an optional climb of Chulu Far East (6059m) that boasts of a breathtaking view of the Annapurna and Gangapurna. &nbsp;We trek past the mystical Tilicho Lake and traverse the Mesokantu La (5100m) to reach Jomsom, the gateway to the kingdom of Mustang. A superb trek that is simply incomparable.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\r\n','<p>Nepalese Visa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nepalese visa can be obtained at the Nepalese Embassy, Consulates or Missions abroad or at the immigration counter at the port of entry in Nepal.

Bread, butter and jam with eggs are usually served for breakfast which is occasionally accompanied by muesli, granola and porridge. Hot chocolate, coffee, tea and juice are served. The crew could surprise you with cakes, pies and pizza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Support staff</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All our Tour Leaders have undergone leadership training and have had intensive courses on mountain medicine, first aid and are capable of handling emergency situations. They are deep understanding and knowledge of the mountain culture and are familiar with high altitude survival skills. Our support crew (except the porters) are usually sherpas who have been the backbone of the trekking industry in Nepal and the team usually has years of experience between them and so our team is prepared for all eventualities in the mountains. &nbsp;The preservation of the fragile Eco system is of utmost importance to us and our support staff is made well aware of the significance of preserving the environment. We conduct regular orientation programs to educate our support crew regarding the importance of conservation of our environment. We take pride in the high quality of service we render &ndash; personalized, professional and above all enjoyable. Our crew with a keen sense of hospitality will make your holiday worthwhile. You will make friends with our tour leader during the trip and find adventure that you will re-live the rest of your life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best Season</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is best to visit this region in spring and autumn.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Spring generally begins in March and ends in May. Though there is a slight haze the forests covered with a riot of scarlet coloured rhododendrons, primulas, daisies, white magnolias and a host of other beautiful plants making a trek an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Mid September heralds the beginning of the autumn season. Mid September to mid November enjoys excellent climate coupled with deep blue sky and clear days making this period the best trekking period of the year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trek Equipment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For camping treks we provide state of the art equipment that comprises of two men North Face Tents, Mess tent, Kitchen tent, Toilet tent, Shower tents, folding chairs, tables, cooking utensils, fuel (kerosene or LPG), all cooking appliances, mattresses, shower pumps, folding toilet seats and gamow bags in case of high altitude treks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transportation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driving is on the left in Nepal but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. Comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photography</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole world uses digital photography these days. The sunlight is very bright during the daytime due to the thin air so please take that into account while filming. Not all of the monasteries and places of interest are open for filming. Some places levy a small amount for every picture taken while in some places it is strictly prohibited so it is advisable to seek the advice of your guide before you take a photo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Group size</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The size of the group could vary from 2 - 16 people. Though we can manage larger groups due to group dynamics we only operate groups up to 16 people. We have limited number of people in all our departures to ensure personalized service. We try and make sure that the need of each and every client is attended to and he/she feels comfortable and can enjoy the amazing culture, landscape and people better and have a great holiday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responsible Tourism</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile. Responsible and sustainable tourism has always been our main thrust and mantra so that the environment and its resources- natural or cultural &ndash; always remain intact for the future generations to savor. We strongly advise that all non-biodegradable items such as can, bottles, batteries, plastics etc to be brought back to Kathmandu for proper disposition. We discourage the use of bottled mineral water to control the plastic bottles&#39; waste. Since water is essential while traveling at such high altitudes we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers. As a part of our responsible tourism drive we use local guides and locally owned hotels (wherever possible) so that the people can earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Packing List</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weather in Nepal can vary significantly, and the best advice is to take clothing that will layer to cover all eventualities.

Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Loss of appetite</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Fatigue</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Headache</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Nausea</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Dizziness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Palpitations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Sleeplessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Breathlessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaccination</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Physical fitness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare yourself by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical Facilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance. You will need to leave your insurance details in our office in Kathmandu during the trip so that we can make necessary arrangements should the need arise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk and Liability&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times.

The trek on this little trodden trail provides new visual perspectives on this area and passes through three of the highest passes in this region. This is arguably one of the most dramatic yet one of the most challenging treks in the Everest region. We trek across quaint Sherpa villages, monasteries, wildlife and dramatic mountain scenery of the area. We gain altitude gradually and enjoy a series of short trekking days, to ensure proper acclimatization. We then trek up the Bhotekosi valley and scramble across the Renjo Pass with breathtaking views of Everest, Lhotse, Makalu and Cho Oyu right in front of us. From Renjo we descend and down to Gokyo. The Gokyo valley is dominated by the massive form of Cho Oyu , at 8153 meters the eight highest peaks on earth. From here we can climb Gokyo Ri (5360m) to a view of all of the region&#39;s 8000-metre peaks including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu and Cho Oyu - a breathtaking panorama. We than walk beside the moraines of the Ngozumpa glacier and turquoise lake and make our way towards Cho La and enter into the Khumbu valley. The trail continues up to Kalapattar for more spectacular views of the surrounding mountains, including the incredible southwest face of Everest. The highlight of the race is the climb of Island Peak. The summit is interesting and attractive with a highly glaciated west face rising from the Lhotse Glacier. The mountain itself is the extension of the South Ridge of Lhotse Shar separated by a small col. The ridge rising to the south from this point leads to the summit of Island Peak. The extension of this ridge descending south-west is the part of the normal route of ascent and leads to the South Summit. Imja Tse not only provides an enjoyable climb but also provides some of the most spectacular scenery of Himalayas in the Khumbu region. We make our way back to Tengboche monastery, the religious lifeline of this area. We then descend down to Lukla and fly back to Katmandu the next day.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\r\n','<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Nepalese Visa</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The Nepalese visa can be obtained at the Nepalese Embassy, Consulates or Missions abroad or at the immigration counter at the port of entry in Nepal.

They are deep understanding and knowledge of the mountain culture and are familiar with high altitude survival skills. Our support crew (except the porters) are usually sherpas who have been the backbone of the trekking industry in Nepal and the team usually has years of experience between them and so our team is prepared for all eventualities in the mountains. &nbsp;The preservation of the fragile Eco system is of utmost importance to us and our support staff is made well aware of the significance of preserving the environment.

Though there is a slight haze the forests covered with a riot of scarlet coloured rhododendrons, primulas, daisies, white magnolias and a host of other beautiful plants making a trek an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&bull; Mid September heralds the beginning of the autumn season. Mid September to mid November enjoys excellent climate coupled with deep blue sky and clear days making this period the best trekking period of the year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Trek Equipment</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>For camping period we provide state of the art equipment that comprises of two men North Face Tents, Mess tent, Kitchen tent, Toilet tent, Shower tents, folding chairs, tables, cooking utensils, fuel (kerosene or LPG), all cooking appliances, mattresses, shower pumps, folding toilet seats and gamow bags in case of high altitude treks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Transportation</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Driving is on the left in Nepal but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. Comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Photography</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The whole world uses digital photography these days. The sunlight is very bright during the daytime due to the thin air so please take that into account while filming. Not all of the monasteries and places of interest are open for filming. Some places levy a small amount for every picture taken while in some places it is strictly prohibited so it is advisable to seek the advice of your guide before you take a photo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Group size</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The size of the group could vary from 2 - 16 people.

We try and make sure that the need of each and every client is attended to and he/she feels comfortable and can enjoy the amazing culture, landscape and people better and have a great holiday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Responsible Tourism</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile. Responsible and sustainable tourism has always been our main thrust and mantra so that the environment and its resources- natural or cultural &ndash; always remain intact for the future generations to savor. We strongly advise that all non-biodegradable items such as can, bottles, batteries, plastics etc to be brought back to Kathmandu for proper disposition. We discourage the use of bottled mineral water to control the plastic bottles&#39; waste. Since water is essential while traveling at such high altitudes we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers. As a part of our responsible tourism drive we use local guides and locally owned hotels (wherever possible) so that the people can earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Packing List</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The weather in Nepal can vary significantly, and the best advice is to take clothing that will layer to cover all eventualities.

So take care in what you eat or drink. Travelling in Nepal does not involve major health risks provided simple precautions are observed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&bull; Drink bottled water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&bull; Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually unpasteurized</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&bull; Do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&bull; Wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Please remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential to avoid illnesses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Altitude sickness</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Sometimes travelers face health hazards mainly due to the high altitude. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&bull; Loss of appetite</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&bull; Fatigue</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&bull; Headache</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&bull; Nausea</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&bull; Dizziness</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&bull; Palpitations</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&bull; Sleeplessness</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&bull; Breathlessness</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Vaccination</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Immunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary..</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Physical fitness</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Since the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare yourself by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Medical Facilities</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>There are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Insurance</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Insurance All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance. You will need to leave your insurance details in our office in Kathmandu during the trip so that we can make necessary arrangements should the need arise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Risk and Liability&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Our trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times.

We begin our trip in Kathmandu, a bustling medieval city. Kathmandu valley&nbsp; is replete with legends and myths. Legend has it that Kathmandu valley was once a great lake and Manjushree is said to have slashed a hill, which is presently known as Chovar, to drain the water to give us Kathmandu valley as we know it. Today it is no longer an expansive watery body but a vast lake of architectural and cultural wonder. This small valley surrounded by mountains and hills that soar up to the sky have seen kingdoms rise and fall and Nepalese art and culture develop and flourish. Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan, the three districts that make up the valley, each has extraordinary history that rivals each other. It is no wonder that seven UNESCO designated world heritage sites are situated within a radius of a few kms in the valley. The commercial and political hub of the kingdom, Kathmandu is the most densely populated city in the whole country. Modern yet traditional, the city offers a window to the glorious past of the valley. Just walking through the narrow lanes of the city is a travel back into time. Unchanged for centuries some of the places look like open air museums with skillfully built temples, palaces and stone structures which bear testimony to the rich cultural and artistic heritage of the city. It is also home to Kumari, the living child goddess who is the protector of the city. Chosen at the age of four or five, the Kumari Devi is the most important of the several living goddesses in Nepal. We then take a breathtaking flight across the eastern Himalayas to Paro, the gateway to Bhutan. Serene, pristine and unpolluted Bhutan is certainly the land of Shangri-la. The mountains are replete with mysticism and Himalayan folklore passed down from one generation to another. A trip to Taktsang monastery, an iconic landmark, believed to be consecrated in the very spot is simply an otherworldly experience. The awe inspiring &lsquo;Dzongs&rdquo; that rise tall over sprawling valleys make a pretty picture and houses built in typical Bhutanese architecture are a treat to see.&nbsp; Though Bhutan has embraced modernization it still clings on to its tradition and culture which is amply evident in all walks of life. Towns like Thimpu, Punakha and Paro offer a window to the glorious past of the area that has remained unchanged for centuries. Some of the places look like open air museums with skillfully built homes, palaces and stone structures which bear testimony to the rich cultural and artistic heritage of the of the people. We also experience how Bhutanese cuisine is prepared firsthand and get involved in the process and also sample the cuisine. We also witness the Thimpu and Paro Tangbi Mani festivals. Bhutanese from many different areas&nbsp; gather to pay respect and to be blessed at this social gathering. Locals dressed in their finest cloth and jewelry attend this celebration of purification. We can enjoy the true essence of Bhutanese people and a preserved steadfast culture. Masked dances are performed in the courtyards of the Dzongs of the area to instruct the onlookers in the ways of Dharma.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n','<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Responsible Travel<br />\r\n	The ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile.

Druk Air and Bhutan Air operate daily flights from Kathmandu &ndash; Paro and vice versa. However this is subject to change. The southern town of Thimpu and Samdrk Dzongkar also act as ports of entry and exit.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Documentation<br />\r\n	The Nepalese visa can be obtained at the Nepalese Embassy, Consulates or Missions abroad or at the immigration counter at the port of entry in Nepal. Multiple entry tourist visas are issued for a period valid for 15 days at US$ 25, 30 days for US$ 40 and 90 days for US$ 100 per person. You will require two passport size photos to acquire the visa. For the Bhutanese Visa please fill up the attached form and send us a copy by mail at least two weeks before your arrival in Bhutan. We will need at least one week (working days) for the visa formalities which will be processed before your arrival. You will receive your visa upon arrival at the port of entry.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Currency<br />\r\n	The currency in Nepal is Nepalese Rupee and in Bhutan is Ngulrum which is equivalent to the India Rupee.&nbsp; Bills are available in 10, 20, 50,100 and 500 denominations. Travellers&rsquo; Cheques can be changed at banks in the cities but not necessarily elsewhere, although some hotels and travel agents are licensed to change money. US dollars in cash are not widely accepted so it is prudent to change your money into rupees before embarking on a trip. Your guide will be able to advise on where to change money. You will need your passport when you change money.&nbsp; Credit cards are accepted in hotels and shops catering to tourists.&nbsp; Credit cards are also useful as an emergency source of cash as there are a lot of automated teller machines in the major cities and towns and the major cities from where money can withdrawn. You may well be approached by people offering black market currency exchange &ndash; this is of course illegal, and hard currency gained in this way often contributes to criminal activities.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Packing List<br />\r\n	Clothing and Footwear<br />\r\n	- Warm down jacket for the cold<br />\r\n	- Warm clothes<br />\r\n	- Spare clothing - several thinner layers are better than one thick layer<br />\r\n	The weather in Nepa/ Bhutan can vary significantly, and the best advice is to take clothing that will layer to cover all eventualities.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	- Walking boots/ shoes - well worn-in, with good ankle support and strong ridged soles with good tread, and spare laces<br />\r\n	- Windproof/waterproof trousers and jacket with hood, good rain gear: It is quite likely to rain at some point whilst you are out.<br />\r\n	- Sunglasses&nbsp;<br />\r\n	- Loop-pile socks - one thick and one thin pair reduces the risk of blisters<br />\r\n	- Long trousers and long-sleeved shirts&nbsp;<br />\r\n	- Sun hat<br />\r\n	- Comfortable clothes - for evenings and comfortable shoes for sightseeing<br />\r\n	- Lightweight survival bag<br />\r\n	- A small rucksack - a bin liner will keep contents dry if it rains<br />\r\n	- Windbreakers/ Jacket<br />\r\n	- Down Sleeping bag<br />\r\n	- Towel&nbsp;<br />\r\n	- Torch&nbsp;<br />\r\n	-money belt; fold-up bag for souvenirs; camera and plenty of spare film; umbrella<br />\r\n	- Water bottle: with at least 1 litre capacity.<br />\r\n	- Moisturizing lotion<br />\r\n	- Insect repellent<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Medical Kit<br />\r\n	We provide a first aid kit with medication for altitude sickness, nausea, dehydration, pain killers, and medication for dysentery, diarrhea, bandages, water purifier, antiseptic creams, throat lozenges, eye drops, antibiotics, nasal sprays, and pain relievers in tubes or spray but it is advisable to carry some medication on you without taking too much room in your baggage. &nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	However we recommend the clients to carry the following items:<br />\r\n	Asprin or Panadol - for pain or fever<br />\r\n	Antihistamine - useful as a decongestant for colds, allergies, to ease the itch from insect bites and stings or to help prevent motion sickness<br />\r\n	Antibiotics-useful if you are traveling well off the beaten track but they must be prescribed<br />\r\n	Kaolin preparation (Pepto-Bismol), Imodium or Lomotil - for stomach upsets and to stop diarrhea and dehydration<br />\r\n	Antiseptic, Mercurochrome and Antibiotic powder or similar &#39;dry&#39; spray-for cuts and grazes<br />\r\n	Calamine lotion-to ease irritation from bites and stings<br />\r\n	Bandages and band-aids- for minor injuries and wounds<br />\r\n	Scissors, Tweezers and a Thermometer<br />\r\n	Throat Lozenges&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Acetaminophen (paracetamol)<br />\r\n	Antacid tablets<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Health<br />\r\n	Prevention is always the best cure. So taking care in what you eat or drink is the best bet. Travelling in Nepal and Bhutan does not involve major health risks providing simple precautions are observed. Drink only bottled water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added. Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually not pasteurized; do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene &ndash; wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water.&nbsp; Please remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential in avoiding illness.&nbsp; Despite these precautions, the change of climate, water and diet may still cause some minor stomach upset, and you should obtain a suitable drug such as Immodium or Lomotil from your pharmacist to take with you.&nbsp; If you can, obtain suppositories, as they are obviously easier to use if you are feeling or being sick.&nbsp; Remember however that these drugs provide relief from the symptoms but don&rsquo;t cure the problem and should not be used if you are dehydrated &ndash; the main treatment is to drink plenty of fluids: weak black tea with a little sugar and diluted fizzy drinks left to go flat are recommended. You should also take a rehydration solution such as Dioralyte in case of severe problems, and don&rsquo;t eat rich or spicy food as you recover.&nbsp; Previous guests have recommended taking a hot water bottle (an aluminium water bottle can serve a dual purpose such as this), which can be a great comfort to an upset stomach.&nbsp; Thoroughly cooked food is the safest bet but not if it has been left to cool. Stomach upsets are the most likely travel health problem but the majority of these upsets are relatively minor. Wash your hands frequently as it&#39;s quite easy to contaminate your own food. You should clean your teeth with purified water rather than straight from the tap. Avoid climatic extremes. Keep out of the sun when it is hot, dress warmly when it is cold. Avoid potential diseases by dressing sensibly. You can get worm infections through bare feet. Try to avoid insect bites by covering bare skin when insects are around, by screening windows or by using insect repellents.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Immunisations<br />\r\n	Immunisations currently recommended for Nepal and Bhutan are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid.&nbsp; Typhoid may be given in two separate injections so you will need to consult your doctor in plenty of time.&nbsp; A vaccination is available for cholera but most doctors no longer consider this worth giving as it has a low success rate and tourists are unlikely to become infected if basic hygiene is observed. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk.&nbsp; You should also ensure that your Tetanus and Polio injections are up-to-date.&nbsp; The situation with regard to vaccinations and health precautions is subject to change, and you should consult your doctor for advice as early as possible.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Medical Facilities<br />\r\n	There are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal and Bhutan<br />\r\n	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\n	Insurance<br />\r\n	All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Best Season<br />\r\n	It is best to visit this region in spring and autumn. Spring generally begins in March and ends in May. Though there is a slight haze the forests covered with a riot of scarlet coloured rhododendrons, primulas, daisies, white magnolias and a host of other beautiful plants making the trip an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Mid September heralds the beginning of the autumn season. Mid September to mid November enjoys excellent climate coupled with deep blue sky and clear days making this period the best period to visit this area.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Accommodation<br />\r\n	We use the tourist class hotels with homely ambience available throughout the trip. They give you an insight into the local culture. The accommodation is based on full board basis throughout except Kathmandu.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Transportation<br />\r\n	Driving is on the left in Nepal and Bhutan but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. In Nepal comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group. In Bhutan the transfers will be in comfortable jeeps.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Risk and Liability&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Our trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times. However sometimes unforeseen circumstances like landslides, floods, bad weather, bad road condition, vehicle breakdown, delay in flights due to bad weather, local political situation could contribute to the change in the program. No claim of refund will be entertained including early return from the trip, or change in itinerary due to unavoidable situations like the above. All extra expenses (apart from the services offered as per the program) that occur in such cases would have to borne directly by t<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Days</span></span></th>\r\n			<th><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Activity</span></span></th>\r\n			<th><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Accomodation</span></span></th>\r\n			<th><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Meals</span></span></th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Day 1</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Arrival in Kathmandu, transfer to Hotel</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Hotel</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">D</span></span></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Day 2</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Full day sightseeing on Kathmandu</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Hotel</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">B</span></span></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Day 3</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Full day sightseeing in Kathmandu</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Hotel</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">B</span></span></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Day 4</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Fly Kathmandu -

Pristine, unspoiled, wild, unchanged and above all untouched by the trappings of modern day life is a remarkable experience. It is one of the most beautiful and unspoiled trekking areas in the entire Himalayas. The trek begins at Drugyel Dzong and passes through quaint and sleepy villages, scattered hamlets and farmlands. The trail passes through richly forested valleys to high alpine pastureland where Yak herders graze their animals. The sight of massive mountains that reach out to touch the sky against the blue sky is a rejuvenating experience. The area is home to rare flora and fauna. Possible encounters with blue sheep, and even the rare snow leopard make the trek very interesting.

Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Loss of appetite</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Fatigue</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Headache</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Nausea</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Dizziness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Palpitations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Sleeplessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Breathlessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaccination</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Physical Fitness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare yourself by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Camping trek</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For camping treks we provide state of the art equipment that comprises of two men North Face Tents, Mess tent, Kitchen tent, Toilet tent, Shower tents, folding chairs, tables, cooking utensils, fuel (kerosene or LPG), all cooking appliances, mattresses, shower pumps, folding toilet seats and gamow bags in case of high altitude treks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currency</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The currency in Nepal is Nepalese Rupee and in Bhutan is Ngulrum which is equivalent to the India Rupee. &nbsp;Bills are available in 10, 20, 50,100 and 500 denominations. Travellers&rsquo; Cheques can be changed at banks in the cities but not necessarily elsewhere, although some hotels and travel agents are licensed to change money. US dollars in cash are not widely accepted so it is prudent to change your money into rupees before embarking on a trip. Your guide will be able to advise on where to change money. You will need your passport when you change money. Credit cards are accepted in hotels and shops catering to tourists. &nbsp;Credit cards are also useful as an emergency source of cash as there are a lot of automated teller machines in the major cities and towns and the major cities from where money can withdrawn. You may well be approached by people offering black market currency exchange &ndash; this is of course illegal, and hard currency gained in this way often contributes to criminal activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What to Take</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clothing and Footwear</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Warm down jacket for the cold</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Warm clothes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Spare clothing - several thinner layers are better than one thick layer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weather in Nepa/ Bhutan can vary significantly, and the best advice is to take clothing that will layer to cover all eventualities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Walking boots/ shoes - well worn-in, with good ankle support and strong ridged soles with good tread, and spare laces</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Windproof/waterproof trousers and jacket with hood, good rain gear: It is quite likely to rain at some point whilst you are out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Sunglasses&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Loop-pile socks - one thick and one thin pair reduces the risk of blisters</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Long trousers and long-sleeved shirts&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Sun hat</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Comfortable clothes - for evenings and comfortable shoes for sightseeing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Lightweight survival bag</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- A small rucksack - a bin liner will keep contents dry if it rains</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Windbreakers/ Jacket</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Down Sleeping bag</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Towel&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Torch&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-money belt; fold-up bag for souvenirs; camera and plenty of spare film; umbrella</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Water bottle: with at least 1 litre capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Moisturizing lotion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Insect repellent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical Kit</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We provide a first aid kit with medication for altitude sickness, nausea, dehydration, pain killers, and medication for dysentery, diarrhea, bandages, water purifier, antiseptic creams, throat lozenges, eye drops, antibiotics, nasal sprays, and pain relievers in tubes or spray but it is advisable to carry some medication on you without taking too much room in your baggage. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However we recommend the clients to carry the following items:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asprin or Panadol - for pain or fever</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antihistamine - useful as a decongestant for colds, allergies, to ease the itch from insect bites and stings or to help prevent motion sickness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antibiotics-useful if you are traveling well off the beaten track but they must be prescribed</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaolin preparation (Pepto-Bismol), Imodium or Lomotil - for stomach upsets and to stop diarrhea and dehydration</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antiseptic, Mercurochrome and Antibiotic powder or similar &#39;dry&#39; spray-for cuts and grazes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calamine lotion-to ease irritation from bites and stings</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bandages and band-aids- for minor injuries and wounds</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scissors, Tweezers and a Thermometer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throat Lozenges&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acetaminophen (paracetamol)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antacid tablets</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Health</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prevention is always the best cure. So taking care in what you eat or drink is the best bet. Travelling in Nepal and Bhutan does not involve major health risks providing simple precautions are observed. Drink only bottled water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added. Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually not pasteurized; do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene &ndash; wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water. &nbsp;Please remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential in avoiding illness. &nbsp;Despite these precautions, the change of climate, water and diet may still cause some minor stomach upset, and you should obtain a suitable drug such as Immodium or Lomotil from your pharmacist to take with you. &nbsp;If you can, obtain suppositories, as they are obviously easier to use if you are feeling or being sick. &nbsp;Remember however that these drugs provide relief from the symptoms but don&rsquo;t cure the problem and should not be used if you are dehydrated &ndash; the main treatment is to drink plenty of fluids: weak black tea with a little sugar and diluted fizzy drinks left to go flat are recommended. You should also take a rehydration solution such as Dioralyte in case of severe problems, and don&rsquo;t eat rich or spicy food as you recover. &nbsp;Previous guests have recommended taking a hot water bottle (an aluminium water bottle can serve a dual purpose such as this), which can be a great comfort to an upset stomach. &nbsp;Thoroughly cooked food is the safest bet but not if it has been left to cool. Stomach upsets are the most likely travel health problem but the majority of these upsets are relatively minor. Wash your hands frequently as it&#39;s quite easy to contaminate your own food. You should clean your teeth with purified water rather than straight from the tap. Avoid climatic extremes. Keep out of the sun when it is hot, dress warmly when it is cold. Avoid potential diseases by dressing sensibly. You can get worm infections through bare feet. Try to avoid insect bites by covering bare skin when insects are around, by screening windows or by using insect repellents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunisations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunisations currently recommended for Nepal and Bhutan are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. &nbsp;Typhoid may be given in two separate injections so you will need to consult your doctor in plenty of time. &nbsp;A vaccination is available for cholera but most doctors no longer consider this worth giving as it has a low success rate and tourists are unlikely to become infected if basic hygiene is observed. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. &nbsp;You should also ensure that your Tetanus and Polio injections are up-to-date. &nbsp;The situation with regard to vaccinations and health precautions is subject to change, and you should consult your doctor for advice as early as possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical Facilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal and Bhutan</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best Season</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is best to visit this region in spring and autumn. Spring generally begins in March and ends in May. Though there is a slight haze the forests covered with a riot of scarlet coloured rhododendrons, primulas, daisies, white magnolias and a host of other beautiful plants making the trip an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mid September heralds the beginning of the autumn season. Mid September to mid November enjoys excellent climate coupled with deep blue sky and clear days making this period the best period to visit this area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accommodation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use the tourist class hotels with homely ambience available throughout the trip. They give you an insight into the local culture. The accommodation is based on full board basis throughout except Kathmandu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transportation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driving is on the left in Nepal and Bhutan but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. In Nepal comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group. In Bhutan the transfers will be in comfortable jeeps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk and Liability&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times. However sometimes unforeseen circumstances like landslides, floods, bad weather, bad road condition, vehicle breakdown, delay in flights due to bad weather, local political situation could contribute to the change in the program. No claim of refund will be entertained including early return from the trip, or change in itinerary due to unavoidable situations like the above</p>\r\n','<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"width:515px\">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style=\"height:15px\">\r\n			<p>Day 1</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height:15px\">\r\n			<p>&nbsp;

The Jhomolhari mountain is sacred to the Tibetan Buddhishts who believe that it is the above of the five Tsheringma sisters who are the female protector goddesses of Tibet and Bhutan. We begin our trek from Paro and cross high altitude pastures, yak herder settlements, pristine forests and high passes. It offers your magnificent views of Jichu Drake and Jhomolhari. We visit the several magnificent dzongs and several cultural sites and experience the vibrant and colorful culture of this magnificent kingdom. The day hike to Taktsang Monastery also known as the Tigers Nest perched high up a cliff overlooking the Paro Valley is the highlight of the trip.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n','<p>Responsible Travel<br />\r\nThe ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile. Responsible and sustainable tourism has always been our main thrust and mantra so that the environment and its resources- natural or cultural &ndash; always remain intact for the future generations to savor. We strongly advise that all non-biodegradable items such as can, bottles, batteries, plastics etc to be brought back for proper disposition. We discourage the use of bottled mineral water to control the plastic waste. Since water is essential while traveling we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers. As a part of our responsible tourism drive we use local guides and locally owned hotels (wherever possible) so that the people can earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility. We are always adding new destinations and in the process working with local communities to forge a partnership to ensure change for the local people as well as visitors.&nbsp; Our tour programs are designed to work closely with the people and the environment of the destination so that the visitors can feel it to be an integral part of their holiday experience.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese trips are tailor-made to give you have a deeper understanding of the local culture and heritage. We visit various sites that are normally off the regular tourist map to generate more awareness regarding these places so that they are preserved for the coming generations to savour. We have designed this trip in the way that can be done by any age group without any prior experience in adventure. Anyone with and spirit of adventure to explore the exotic can enjoy the thrills of this trip. We encourage interaction between our clients and the locals through home or school visit, teaching local dance and dialects so that the clients have a better understanding of the countries they are visiting. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGroup size<br />\r\nThe size of the group could vary from 2 - 16 people. Though we can manage larger groups due to group dynamics we only operate groups up to 16 people. We have limited number of people in all our departures to ensure personalized service. We try and make sure that the need of each and every client is attended to and he/she feels comfortable and can enjoy the amazing culture, landscape and people better and have a great holiday.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStaff on the trip<br />\r\nOrientation programs to educate our support crew on environmental conservation and its importance are undertaken periodically. We provide opportunities for local people to earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility. With years of experience, research and suggestions of experts and clients, this trip has been put together with utmost consideration of our clients&#39; expectations, comfort and safety. All our staff is highly qualified in their field and we provide the best service and equipments for our clients&#39; satisfaction, comfort and safety. Their knowledge on local culture and customs makes your trip an extra exciting.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccess<br />\r\nSeveral international airlines connect Kathmandu to various parts of the globe.Bhutan is accessible by air from Paro, the only airport in this tiny Himalayan Kingdom. Druk Air and Bhutan Air operate daily flights from Kathmandu &ndash; Paro and vice versa. However this is subject to change. The southern town of Thimpu and Samdrk Dzongkar also act as ports of entry and exit.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDocumentation<br />\r\nThe Nepalese visa can be obtained at the Nepalese Embassy, Consulates or Missions abroad or at the immigration counter at the port of entry in Nepal. Multiple entry tourist visas are issued for a period valid for 15 days at US$ 25, 30 days for US$ 40 and 90 days for US$ 100 per person. You will require two passport size photos to acquire the visa. For the Bhutanese Visa please fill up the attached form and send us a copy by mail at least two weeks before your arrival in Bhutan. We will need at least one week (working days) for the visa formalities which will be processed before your arrival. You will receive your visa upon arrival at the port of entry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAltitiude sickness<br />\r\nSometimes travelers face health hazards mainly due to the high altitude. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThese changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Loss of appetite<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fatigue<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Headache<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nausea<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dizziness<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Palpitations<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sleeplessness<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Breathlessness<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVaccination<br />\r\nImmunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary..<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhysical Fitness<br />\r\nSince the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare yourself by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCamping trek<br />\r\nFor camping treks we provide state of the art equipment that comprises of two men North Face Tents, Mess tent, Kitchen tent, Toilet tent, Shower tents, folding chairs, tables, cooking utensils, fuel (kerosene or LPG), all cooking appliances, mattresses, shower pumps, folding toilet seats and gamow bags in case of high altitude treks.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrency<br />\r\nThe currency in Nepal is Nepalese Rupee and in Bhutan is Ngulrum which is equivalent to the India Rupee.&nbsp; Bills are available in 10, 20, 50,100 and 500 denominations. Travellers&rsquo; Cheques can be changed at banks in the cities but not necessarily elsewhere, although some hotels and travel agents are licensed to change money. US dollars in cash are not widely accepted so it is prudent to change your money into rupees before embarking on a trip. Your guide will be able to advise on where to change money. You will need your passport when you change money.&nbsp; Credit cards are accepted in hotels and shops catering to tourists.&nbsp; Credit cards are also useful as an emergency source of cash as there are a lot of automated teller machines in the major cities and towns and the major cities from where money can withdrawn. You may well be approached by people offering black market currency exchange &ndash; this is of course illegal, and hard currency gained in this way often contributes to criminal activities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPacking List<br />\r\nClothing and Footwear<br />\r\n- Warm down jacket for the cold<br />\r\n- Warm clothes<br />\r\n- Spare clothing - several thinner layers are better than one thick layer<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe weather in Nepa/ Bhutan can vary significantly, and the best advice is to take clothing that will layer to cover all eventualities.&nbsp;<br />\r\n- Walking boots/ shoes - well worn-in, with good ankle support and strong ridged soles with good tread, and spare laces<br />\r\n- Windproof/waterproof trousers and jacket with hood, good rain gear: It is quite likely to rain at some point whilst you are out.<br />\r\n- Sunglasses&nbsp;<br />\r\n- Loop-pile socks - one thick and one thin pair reduces the risk of blisters<br />\r\n- Long trousers and long-sleeved shirts&nbsp;<br />\r\n- Sun hat<br />\r\n- Comfortable clothes - for evenings and comfortable shoes for sightseeing<br />\r\n- Lightweight survival bag<br />\r\n- A small rucksack - a bin liner will keep contents dry if it rains<br />\r\n- Windbreakers/ Jacket<br />\r\n- Down Sleeping bag<br />\r\n- Towel&nbsp;<br />\r\n- Torch&nbsp;<br />\r\n- Money belt; fold-up bag for souvenirs; camera and plenty of spare film; umbrella<br />\r\n- Water bottle: with at least 1 litre capacity.<br />\r\n- Moisturizing lotion<br />\r\n- Insect repellent<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMedical Kit<br />\r\nWe provide a first aid kit with medication for altitude sickness, nausea, dehydration, pain killers, and medication for dysentery, diarrhea, bandages, water purifier, antiseptic creams, throat lozenges, eye drops, antibiotics, nasal sprays, and pain relievers in tubes or spray but it is advisable to carry some medication on you without taking too much room in your baggage. &nbsp;<br />\r\nHowever we recommend the clients to carry the following items:<br />\r\nAsprin or Panadol - for pain or fever<br />\r\nAntihistamine - useful as a decongestant for colds, allergies, to ease the itch from insect bites and stings or to help prevent motion sickness<br />\r\nAntibiotics-useful if you are traveling well off the beaten track but they must be prescribed<br />\r\nKaolin preparation (Pepto-Bismol), Imodium or Lomotil - for stomach upsets and to stop diarrhea and dehydration<br />\r\nAntiseptic, Mercurochrome and Antibiotic powder or similar &#39;dry&#39; spray-for cuts and grazes<br />\r\nCalamine lotion-to ease irritation from bites and stings<br />\r\nBandages and band-aids- for minor injuries and wounds<br />\r\nScissors, Tweezers and a Thermometer<br />\r\nThroat Lozenges&nbsp;<br />\r\nAcetaminophen (paracetamol)<br />\r\nAntacid tablets<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHealth<br />\r\nPrevention is always the best cure. So taking care in what you eat or drink is the best bet. Travelling in Nepal and Bhutan does not involve major health risks providing simple precautions are observed. Drink only bottled water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added. Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually not pasteurized; do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene &ndash; wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water.&nbsp; Please remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential in avoiding illness.&nbsp; Despite these precautions, the change of climate, water and diet may still cause some minor stomach upset, and you should obtain a suitable drug such as Immodium or Lomotil from your pharmacist to take with you.&nbsp; If you can, obtain suppositories, as they are obviously easier to use if you are feeling or being sick.&nbsp; Remember however that these drugs provide relief from the symptoms but don&rsquo;t cure the problem and should not be used if you are dehydrated &ndash; the main treatment is to drink plenty of fluids: weak black tea with a little sugar and diluted fizzy drinks left to go flat are recommended. You should also take a rehydration solution such as Dioralyte in case of severe problems, and don&rsquo;t eat rich or spicy food as you recover.&nbsp; Previous guests have recommended taking a hot water bottle (an aluminium water bottle can serve a dual purpose such as this), which can be a great comfort to an upset stomach.&nbsp; Thoroughly cooked food is the safest bet but not if it has been left to cool. Stomach upsets are the most likely travel health problem but the majority of these upsets are relatively minor. Wash your hands frequently as it&#39;s quite easy to contaminate your own food. You should clean your teeth with purified water rather than straight from the tap. Avoid climatic extremes. Keep out of the sun when it is hot, dress warmly when it is cold. Avoid potential diseases by dressing sensibly. You can get worm infections through bare feet. Try to avoid insect bites by covering bare skin when insects are around, by screening windows or by using insect repellents.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nImmunisations<br />\r\nImmunisations currently recommended for Nepal and Bhutan are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid.&nbsp; Typhoid may be given in two separate injections so you will need to consult your doctor in plenty of time.&nbsp; A vaccination is available for cholera but most doctors no longer consider this worth giving as it has a low success rate and tourists are unlikely to become infected if basic hygiene is observed. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk.&nbsp; You should also ensure that your Tetanus and Polio injections are up-to-date.&nbsp; The situation with regard to vaccinations and health precautions is subject to change, and you should consult your doctor for advice as early as possible.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMedical Facilities<br />\r\nThere are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal and Bhutan<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nInsurance<br />\r\nAll the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBest Season<br />\r\nIt is best to visit this region in spring and autumn. Spring generally begins in March and ends in May. Though there is a slight haze the forests covered with a riot of scarlet coloured rhododendrons, primulas, daisies, white magnolias and a host of other beautiful plants making the trip an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMid September heralds the beginning of the autumn season. Mid September to mid November enjoys excellent climate coupled with deep blue sky and clear days making this period the best period to visit this area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccommodation<br />\r\nWe use the tourist class hotels with homely ambience available throughout the trip. They give you an insight into the local culture. The accommodation is based on full board basis throughout except Kathmandu.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTransportation<br />\r\nDriving is on the left in Nepal and Bhutan but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. In Nepal comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group. In Bhutan the transfers will be in comfortable jeeps.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRisk and Liability&nbsp;<br />\r\nOur trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times. However sometimes unforeseen circumstances like landslides, floods, bad weather, bad road condition, vehicle breakdown, delay in flights due to bad weather, local political situation could contribute to the change in the program. No claim of refund will be entertained including early return from the trip, or change in itinerary due to unavoidable situations like the above. All extra expenses (apart from the services offered as per the program) that occur in such cases would have to borne directly by the traveler,</p>\r\n','<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Days</span></span></th>\r\n			<th><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Activity</span></span></th>\r\n			<th><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Accomodation</span></span></th>\r\n			<th><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">&nbsp;Meals</span></span></th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Day 1</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Arrival in Kathmandu, transfer to Hotel</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Hotel</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">D</span></span></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Day 2</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Full day sightseeing on Kathmandu</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Hotel</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">B</span></span></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Day 3</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Full day sightseeing in Kathmandu</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Hotel</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">B</span></span></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Day 4</span></span></td>\r\n			<td><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Fly Kathmandu -

The highlight of the trip is a visit to the homes run by the Missionaries of Charity, an order founded by Mother Teresa, is a touching experience. &nbsp;A visit to this city that has played a very important in shaping up India is a journey of contemplation and self discovery. We visit one of the oldest museums of the world and immerse ourselves in a treasure trove of ancient artifacts and objects of art, culture and history. We then major sites of Darjeeling and enjoy the charm of the quaint towns that dot the Darjeeling hills. We get a glimpse of the glorious heritage of Darjeeling and enjoy the magnificent sights and sounds of the hill station that draws hordes of tourist every year. The charming cottages, the glorious mountains, the mesmerizing sunrise over Kanchenjunga and the whiff of fresh air are quintessentially Darjeeling. &nbsp;We immerse ourselves in the warmth and unique culture of Sikkim. Sikkim is replete with myths and legends that have been woven into the fabric of local life through generations. We make a wish on a sacred lake, offer our prayers in one of the oldest monasteries of the region, have our meals against the backdrop of the majestic Kanchenjunga, visit the seat of the Karmapa and enjoy the vibrant life in Gangtok. Our next few days are spent in sleeping town of Kalimpong enjoying the beautiful landscape and the exotic flower nurseries. We visit the Dr. Graham&rsquo;s Homes School a sprawling educational institution that gives a glimpse to Kalimpong&rsquo;s European influence. Built in 1880, today it is spread over a hill it has its own dairy, bakery, poultry farm and vegetable gardens. It is a fitting example of community life. We travel across the rolling hills and the Gangetic plains to the city of Agra. The highlight is the Taj Mahal the glorious symbol of craftsmanship and vision. This historical marvel is not just an architectural marvel but an icon of love and devotion. We visit other heritage sites of the city and immerse ourselves in the architecture and history of this area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n','<p>Responsible Travel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile. Responsible and sustainable tourism has always been our main thrust and mantra so that the environment and its resources- natural or cultural &ndash; always remain intact for the future generations to savor. We strongly advise that all non-biodegradable items such as can, bottles, batteries, plastics etc to be brought back to Darjeeling for proper disposition. We discourage the use of bottled mineral water to control the plastic waste. Since water is essential while traveling we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers. As a part of our responsible tourism drive we use local guides and locally owned hotels (wherever possible) so that the people can earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility. We are always adding new destinations and in the process working with local communities to forge a partnership to ensure change for the local people as well as visitors. &nbsp;Our tour programs are designed to work closely with the people and the environment of the destination so that the visitors can feel it to be an integral part of their holiday experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This heritage tour is tailor-made to give you have a deeper understanding of the local culture and heritage. We visit various sites that are normally off the regular tourist map to generate more awareness regarding these places so that they are preserved for the coming generations to savour.

So taking care in what you eat or drink is the best bet. Travelling in India does not involve major health risks providing simple precautions are observed. Drink only bottled water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added. Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually unpasteurised; do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene &ndash; wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water. &nbsp;Please remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential in avoiding illness. &nbsp;Despite these precautions, the change of climate, water and diet may still cause some minor stomach upset, and you should obtain a suitable drug such as Immodium or Lomotil from your pharmacist to take with you. &nbsp;If you can, obtain suppositories, as they are obviously easier to use if you are feeling or being sick. &nbsp;Remember however that these drugs provide relief from the symptoms but don&rsquo;t cure the problem and should not be used if you are dehydrated &ndash; the main treatment is to drink plenty of fluids: weak black tea with a little sugar and diluted fizzy drinks left to go flat are recommended. You should also take a rehydration solution such as Dioralyte in case of severe problems, and don&rsquo;t eat rich or spicy food as you recover. &nbsp;Previous guests have recommended taking a hot water bottle (an aluminium water bottle can serve a dual purpose such as this), which can be a great comfort to an upset stomach. Thoroughly cooked food is the safest bet but not if it has been left to cool. Stomach upsets are the most likely travel health problem but the majority of these upsets are relatively minor. Wash your hands frequently as it&#39;s quite easy to contaminate your own food. You should clean your teeth with purified water rather than straight from the tap. Avoid climatic extremes. Keep out of the sun when it is hot, dress warmly when it is cold. Avoid potential diseases by dressing sensibly. You can get worm infections through bare feet. Try to avoid insect bites by covering bare skin when insects are around, by screening windows or by using insect repellents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunisations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunisations currently recommended for India are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. &nbsp;Typhoid may be given in two separate injections so you will need to consult your doctor in plenty of time. &nbsp;A vaccination is available for cholera but most doctors no longer consider this worth giving as it has a low success rate and tourists are unlikely to become infected if basic hygiene is observed. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. &nbsp;You should also ensure that your Tetanus and Polio injections are up-to-date. &nbsp;The situation with regard to vaccinations and health precautions is subject to change, and you should consult your doctor for advice as early as possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical Facilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time Zones&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India is 5 hours 30 minutes ahead of GMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best Season</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is best to visit this region in spring and autumn. Spring generally begins in March and ends in May. Though there is a slight haze the forests covered with a riot of scarlet coloured rhododendrons, primulas, daisies, white magnolias and a host of other beautiful plants making the visit an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mid September heralds the beginning of the autumn season. Mid September to mid November enjoys excellent climate coupled with deep blue sky and clear days making this period the period of the year to visit this area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accommodation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use the tourist class hotels with homely ambience available throughout the trip. They give you an insight into the local culture. The accommodation is based on full board basis throughout except Calcutta and Delhi.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transportation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driving is on the left in India but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. Comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group. For groups up to 8 people we use Scorpio, Tavera, Toyota Qualis, Ford Endeavour and Toyota Innova. For bigger groups we use, Tata Tempo, regular and deluxe coaches depending upon the category of the group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk and Liability&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times. However sometimes unforeseen circumstances like landslides, floods, bad weather, bad road condition, vehicle breakdown, delay in flights due to bad weather, local political situation could contribute to the change in the program. No claim of refund will be entertained including early return from the trip, or change in itinerary due to unavoidable situations like the above. All extra expenses (apart from the services offered as per the program) that occur in such cases would have to borne directly by the clients themselves.</p>\r\n','<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Days</th>\r\n			<th>Activity</th>\r\n			<th>Accomodation</th>\r\n			<th>Meals</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 1</td>\r\n			<td>Late night arrival in Calcutta</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 2</td>\r\n			<td>Full day sightseeing in Calcutta</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>B</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 3</td>\r\n			<td>Fly Kolkata to Bagdogra, drive to Kurseong</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 4</td>\r\n			<td>Half day sightseeing, transfer to Darjeeling in the afternoon</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 5</td>\r\n			<td>Full day sightseeing in Darjeeling</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 6</td>\r\n			<td>Drive to Pelling</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 7</td>\r\n			<td>Full day sightseeing</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 8</td>\r\n			<td>Drive to Martam, Afternoon excursion</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 9</td>\r\n			<td>Drive to Gangtok, visit Rumtek Monastery en route</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 10</td>\r\n			<td>Morning sightseeing and afternoon drive to Kalimpong</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 11</td>\r\n			<td>Lava and Lolaygaon for a full day excursion</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 12</td>\r\n			<td>Drive to Bagdogra, Fly to Delhi</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>B</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 13</td>\r\n			<td>Transfer to Agra by train, full day sightseeing, evening drive to Delhi and international departure</td>\r\n			<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n			<td>B</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n','<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<table>\r\n		<thead>\r\n			<tr>\r\n				<th>Group Size</th>\r\n				<th>Cost Per Person</th>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		</thead>\r\n		<tbody>\r\n			<tr>\r\n				<td>2 - 4 Pax</td>\r\n				<td>$1645</td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n				<td>5 - 8 Pax</td>\r\n				<td>$1400</td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n				<td>9 - 12 Pax</td>\r\n				<td>$1340</td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n				<td>12 Pax and above</td>\r\n				<td>$1300</td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n				<td>Single tent/room supplement</td>\r\n				<td>$250</td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n		</tbody>\r\n	</table>\r\n\r\n	<p><strong>Cost Includes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li>2 nights at Hotel in Calcutta on BB basis&nbsp;</li>\r\n		<li>All transfers as per program</li>\r\n		<li>Sightseeing with cultural guide as per program</li>\r\n		<li>All entrance fees as per program</li>\r\n		<li>1 night at Hotel in Kurseong on twin sharing and full board basis</li>\r\n		<li>2 nights at Hotel in Darjeeling on twin sharing and full board basis</li>\r\n		<li>2 nights at Hotel &nbsp;in Pelling on twin sharing and full board basis</li>\r\n		<li>1 night Hotel in Gangtok on twin sharing and full board basis</li>\r\n		<li>1 night in Martam on twin sharing and full board basis</li>\r\n		<li>2 nights Hotel in Kalimpong on twin sharing and full board basis</li>\r\n		<li>1 English speaking guide and escort throughout the trip</li>\r\n		<li>1 night accommodation in Delhi on twin sharing and BB basis&nbsp;</li>\r\n		<li>Train in chair class for Delhi - Agra&nbsp;</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p><strong>Cost Excludes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li>International Airfare</li>\r\n		<li>Visa fees for India</li>\r\n		<li>Airfare Calcutta - Bagdogra</li>\r\n		<li>Airfare Bagdogra - Delhi</li>\r\n		<li>Airport transfer in Delhi</li>\r\n		<li>Laundry, bottled drinks and beverages</li>\r\n		<li>Telephone medical kit, tips, personal natured expenses</li>\r\n		<li>Personal travel insurance including rescue and evacuation,</li>\r\n		<li>Extra expenses incurred due to unforeseen circumstances</li>\r\n		<li>Lunch and dinner in Calcutta, Delhi and Agra&nbsp;</li>\r\n		<li>Room for wash and change in Delhi</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n','','2016-12-26 15:29:06','admin','2017-07-18 05:46:52','admin'),

Upon arrival in Delhi we will be transferred to the Oberoi Maidens Hotel which is an oasis of calm in the midst of the chaos of the capital city. We then transfer to Darjeeling, a famous hill-station that still retains the flavour and charm of the British Raj. We enjoy breathtaking sunrises and enjoy a ride on the celebrated toy train all under the shadow of the glorious Kanchenjunga. We then travel to Pelling and absorb the sights and sounds of Sikkim. Prayers flags atop ridges, monks in saffron robes, charming village resorts surrounded by rice fields, are captivating images of Sikkim. We visit the mystical lake of Khecheopalri where as per local legend guardian birds do not permit even a single leaf to float on the lake surface. Yuksom our next stop is a small hamlet is truly the gateway to Shangrila. We visit the coronation throne of the 1st King of Sikkim and Norbughang Chorten. The trek into the realm of the Kanchenjunga is simply an exhilarating experience. &nbsp;We trek through pristine forests with an array of rich and diverse plants and trees and camp alongside glaciated lakes and beneath snow-covered peaks. The clean fresh air, the sparking streams and the waterfall that dot the trail make is a blissful experience. &nbsp;The figure of Kanchenjunga rising against the blue sky is a magical sight. The trek is fairly moderate and everyone with a spirit of adventure and sound health can do it. No previous trekking experience is necessary. During spring the flowers are in full bloom and the jungle is splashed with a riot of colours. The fresh smell of magnolia, wild primulas, daisies and a viariety of rhodeodendrons and wild orchids simply transforms it into a paradise. Martam Village our next stop on the trip is a sleepy hamlet that allows us to experience the rich and diverse culture of the local people up close and personal. We visit the major sites in Gangtok and Kalimpong. We visit the major sites of these sleepy towns and enjoy the historical and cultural heritage of these towns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n','<p>Trekking</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though many credit Colonel Jimmy Roberts of pioneering trekking in the Himalayas it is said that a priest is supposed to have encouraged it in Darjeeling. Jesuit Rev.Fr Macdonald is attributed to have initiated trekking in the Darjeeling Hills almost 80 years ago when he trekked the along beautiful ridges to enjoy the bounties of nature. The trek we offer enables us to discover the passion of the Himalayan region some of which is unmarred by humans. They are a journey to self discovery &ndash; a passage to the personal Shangri-la. The stunning views, the exotic flora and fauna and the culture make trekking a rewarding holiday. This trek does not require any previous experience. Anyone with sound health and mind, and love for nature can go on this trek. Though treks require negotiating steep climbs and descents you can set up your own pace and need not wear yourself out. This program has been tailor made taking into consideration all these aspects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responsible Tourism</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile. Responsible and sustainable tourism has always been our main thrust and mantra so that the environment and its resources- natural or cultural &ndash; always remain intact for the future generations to savor. We strongly advise that all non-biodegradable items such as can, bottles, batteries, plastics etc to be brought back to Darjeeling for proper disposition. We discourage the use of bottled mineral water to control the plastic waste. Since water is essential while traveling at such high altitudes we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers. As a part of our responsible tourism drive we use local guides and locally owned hotels (wherever possible) so that the people can earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility. We are always adding new destinations and in the process working with local communities to forge a partnership to ensure change for the local people as well as visitors. &nbsp;Our tour programs are designed to work closely with the people and the environment of the destination so that the visitors can feel it to be an integral part of their holiday experience. We offer different tours and treks which provide an insight at the treasures that the region has to offer. This trip is tailor-made to give you have a deeper understanding of the local culture and heritage. You can spend some days in a place and be among the &ldquo;real&rdquo; local people and enjoy a genuine cross cultural experience rather than &ldquo;on the surface experience&rdquo;. We have set some environmental codes that it adheres to strictly to ensure the preservation of our fragile ecology. We burn or bury all biodegradable rubbish properly and clients are discouraged to buy mineral water to control the plastic bottle waste. Instead we provide boiled and filtered water to our clients throughout the trek. We discourage the clients to buy any animal products. We make an effort to use hotels/ lodges that pursue good environmental practices. We strive to provide our clients with key information like dress codes, local language and customs regarding the destinations. Orientation programs to educate our trekking support crew on environmental conservation and its importance are undertaken periodically.

So taking care in what you eat or drink is the best bet. Travelling in India does not involve major health risks providing simple precautions are observed. Drink only bottled water or boiled, filtered and treated water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added. Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually unpasteurised; do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene &ndash; wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water. &nbsp;Please remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential in avoiding illness. &nbsp;Despite these precautions, the change of climate, water and diet may still cause some minor stomach upset, and you should obtain a suitable drug such as Immodium or Lomotil from your pharmacist to take with you. &nbsp;If you can, obtain suppositories, as they are obviously easier to use if you are feeling or being sick. &nbsp;Remember however that these drugs provide relief from the symptoms but don&rsquo;t cure the problem and should not be used if you are dehydrated &ndash; the main treatment is to drink plenty of fluids: weak black tea with a little sugar and diluted fizzy drinks left to go flat are recommended. You should also take a rehydration solution such as Dioralyte in case of severe problems, and don&rsquo;t eat rich or spicy food as you recover. &nbsp;Previous guests have recommended taking a hot water bottle (an aluminium water bottle can serve a dual purpose such as this), which can be a great comfort to an upset stomach. &nbsp;Thoroughly cooked food is the safest bet but not if it has been left to cool. Stomach upsets are the most likely travel health problem but the majority of these upsets are relatively minor. Wash your hands frequently as it&#39;s quite easy to contaminate your own food. You should clean your teeth with purified water rather than straight from the tap. Avoid climatic extremes. Keep out of the sun when it is hot, dress warmly when it is cold. Avoid potential diseases by dressing sensibly. You can get worm infections through bare feet. Try to avoid insect bites by covering bare skin when insects are around, by screening windows or by using insect repellents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Altitude Sickness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes travelers face health hazards mainly due to the high altitude. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as loss of appetite, fatigue, headache, nausea, dizziness, palpitations, sleeplessness, breathlessness. The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. If the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Safety&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have been successfully organizing treks since the inception of the company. Safety is number one priority for us. This itinerary has been meticulously planned and designed with years of experience and know - how. Thorough planning, good logistical coordination and support of experienced staff ensure that our clients enjoy the trip to the utmost. Our support staff is also well equipped with communication devices so that they can get help should a situation an emergency situation arise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunisations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunisations currently recommended for India are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. &nbsp;Typhoid may be given in two separate injections so you will need to consult your doctor in plenty of time. &nbsp;A vaccination is available for cholera but most doctors no longer consider this worth giving as it has a low success rate and tourists are unlikely to become infected if basic hygiene is observed. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. &nbsp;Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary. You should also ensure that your Tetanus and Polio injections are up-to-date. &nbsp;The situation with regard to vaccinations and health precautions is subject to change, and you should consult your doctor for advice as early as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Physical Fitness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare your self by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical Facilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time Zones&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India is 5 hours 30 minutes ahead of GMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drinking Water</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While on trek we serve boiled and filtered clean bacteria free water everyday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food on the trek</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our mobile kitchen crew serves Nepalese, Indian and Continental fare during camping treks. Bread, butter and jam with eggs are usually served for breakfast which is occasionally accompanied by muesli, granola and porridge. Hot chocolate, coffee, tea and juice are served. The crew could surprise you with cakes, pies and pizza.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Support Crew</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The support comprises of a qualified tour leader, sirdar, sherpas and porters or pack animals. All our staff are locals who are experts in their field. They are well trained and experienced to handle clients&#39; individual needs. Their knowledge on local culture and customs makes your trip an extra exciting. All our Tour Leaders have undergone leadership training and have had intensive courses on mountain medicine, first aid and are capable of handling emergency situations. They are deep understanding and knowledge of the mountain culture and are familiar with high altitude survival skills. Our support crew (except the porters) are usually sherpas who have been the backbone of the tourism industry in these parts and the team usually has years of experience between them and so our team is prepared for all eventualities in the mountains. The preservation of the fragile Eco system is of utmost importance to us and our support staff is made well aware of the significance of preserving the environment. We conduct regular orientation programs to educate our support crew regarding the importance of conservation of our environment. We take pride in the high quality of service we render &ndash; personalized, professional and above all enjoyable. Our crew with a keen sense of hospitality will make your holiday worthwhile. You will make friends with our tour leader during the trip and find adventure that you will re-live the rest of your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best Season</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is best to visit this region in spring and autumn. Spring generally begins in March and ends in May. Though there is a slight haze the forests covered with a riot of scarlet coloured rhododendrons, primulas, daisies, white magnolias and a host of other beautiful plants making a trek an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mid September heralds the beginning of the autumn season. Mid September to mid November enjoys excellent climate coupled with deep blue sky and clear days making this period the best trekking period of the year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trek equipment&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For camping treks we provide state of the art equipment that comprises of two men North Face Tents, Mess tent, Kitchen tent, Toilet tent, Shower tents, folding chairs, tables, cooking utensils, fuel (kerosene or LPG), all cooking appliances, mattresses, shower pumps, folding toilet seats and gamow bags in case of high altitude treks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accommodation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use the tourist class hotels with homely ambience available throughout the trip.

(31,'Singalila Trek','Into the realm of the Red Panda','singalila-trek','[\"7\",\"110\"]','singalila-trek1497430007.jpg','15 ','',18,'','','','<p>The Panda kingdom is a premier eco tour designed to facilitate and support the protection of the rare and elusive Red Panda. We fly in to the Eastern Indian Metropolis of Calcutta and enjoy the various historical sites that &ldquo;the city of joy&rdquo; has to offer. The city is alive and colourful, and also a heady m&eacute;lange of various shades. And a tour of this pulsating city of literary figures, political thinkers, scientists, social reformers and artists who have shaped up modern India is a rewarding experience. We then travel to Darjeeling, often referred to as &ldquo;the queen of hills&rdquo;, and visit the major sites there. Perched on a hill Darjeeling offers spellbinding views of the Kanchenjunga Massif. We explore heritage landmarks that stand today as remnants of the British Raj. We enjoy the glorious sunrise from Tiger Hill unmatched in this part of the world and visit the popular sites of the town.&nbsp; The next six days we trek to the heart of the Singalila range and relish astounding views of the Himalayas. The Singalila National Park is a treasure trove of rare flora and fauna. If we are lucky we might bump into numerous secrets that it holds and is ready to reveal.&nbsp; We begin from Manebhanjyang on the foot of the Singalila National Park and trek through some of the Eastern Himalayas most pristine Red Panda habitat in search of one of Asia&#39;s most elusive mammals. We will visit one of the highest organic tea estates in the world at Meghma that produces the veritable oolong tea. At Gairibas we meet people from the Panda Initiative who will familiarize us with their work. With their help we also look for rare animals like the clouded leopard, musk deer, snow leopard, himalayan black bear and a host of threatened bird species like the Spiny Babbler Scarlet Minivet, Kalij Pheasant, Blood Pheasant, Satyr Tragopan, Brown and Fulvous Parrotbills, Rufous-vented Tit, and Old World babblers like the Fire-tailed Myzornis and the Golden-breasted Fulvetta. We spend the next three days looking for the Red Panda and also understanding the habitat and the habits of this extraordinary creature. The next couple of days we trek through some of the most pristine and striking environments. We literally trek above the clouds with the Himalayan giants like the Kanchenjunga, Everest, Lhotse and Makalu to keep us company.&nbsp; During spring the forests come alive with vibrant magnolias, primulas, wild daisies and rhododendron.</p>\r\n','<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Trekking<br />\r\n	Though many credit Colonel Jimmy Roberts of pioneering trekking in the Himalayas it is said that a priest is supposed to have encouraged it in Darjeeling. Jesuit Rev.Fr Macdonald is attributed to have initiated trekking in the Darjeeling Hills almost 80 years ago when he trekked the along beautiful ridges to enjoy the bounties of nature. The trek we offer enables us to discover the passion of the Himalayan region some of which is unmarred by humans. They are a journey to self discovery &ndash; a passage to the personal Shangri-la. The stunning views, the exotic flora and fauna and the culture make trekking a rewarding holiday. This trek does not require any previous experience. Anyone with sound health and mind, and love for nature can go on this trek. Though treks require negotiating steep climbs and descents you can set up your own pace and need not wear yourself out. This program has been tailor made taking into consideration all these aspects.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Responsible Tourism<br />\r\n	We offer different treks and tours which provide an insight at the treasures that the region has to offer. The Panda Kingdom is a wildlife program customized to raise awareness on environment conservation and deeply understand the social and ecological value of our natural surroundings and how it affects our lives. The tour, a part of our Panda Initiative, provides you to be directly involved in the conservation of wildlife by interacting with the local people and encouraging them to preserve their surroundings. This program provides you the option to positively make an impact on the lives of other people giving the trip a whole new meaning. You can spend some days in a place and be among the &ldquo;real&rdquo; local people and enjoy a genuine cross cultural experience rather than &ldquo;on the surface experience&rdquo;. It is also a part of our homestay program that provides you the chance to stay with local households. This relatively new way of traveling encourages and supports conservation as well as provides employment and a source of income to the household ensuring that the money is not just concentrated with the people who operate the trip. This program is also open to volunteers and students who are interested to come and work with the local people regarding the red panda. It will give you an opportunity to change the way you view yourselves and also leave a lasting memory on the beneficiaries. No classroom can match the knowledge gained through firsthand experience. It is a rich opportunity for learning to grow personally and develop leadership qualities that are essential to cope with this ever demanding environment that we are exposed to everyday.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	The Panda Initiative<br />\r\n	The Panda Initiative is a joint local effort of the local residents of Manebhanjyang and Tumling with advice from conservationists, tourism professionals to generate awareness at the grass root level and conserve these rare animals along with scores of other birds and animals that are at high risk. With local participation the project runs workshops, awareness and educational programs to generate awareness regarding this exotic creature. The Panda Initiative works with officials of the Singalila National Park, one of the few national parks where these remarkable animals roam freely, the locals who live in the vicinity of the Park. The loss of habitat, public ignorance, competition from livestock are some of the many reasons for the decline of these exotic animals. Educational programs, awareness programs, eco workshops and alternative job creation among the locals are some of the prime focuses of the Panda Initiative to ensure the conservation of the animals that inhabit the park. This eco tour conducted in collaboration with Panda Initiative helps us learn more about these elusive creatures. The money collected from the programs and the proceeds from you go a long way in sustaining the habitat of red pandas in the Singalila National Park, one of the last remaining shelters of these rare animals.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Protecting the environment<br />\r\n	The ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile. Responsible and sustainable tourism has always been our main thrust and mantra so that the environment and its resources- natural or cultural &ndash; always remain intact for the future generations to savor. We strongly advise that all non-biodegradable items such as can, bottles, batteries, plastics etc to be brought back to Darjeeling for proper disposition. We discourage the use of bottled mineral water to control the plastic waste. Since water is essential while traveling at such high altitudes we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers. As a part of our responsible tourism drive we use local guides and locally owned hotels (wherever possible)/ lodges or homes so that the people can earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility.. We have set some environmental codes that it adheres to strictly to ensure the preservation of our fragile ecology. We burn or bury all biodegradable rubbish properly and clients are discouraged to buy mineral water to control the plastic bottle waste. Instead we provide boiled and filtered water to our clients throughout the trek. We discourage the clients to buy any animal products. We make an effort to use hotels/ lodges that pursue good environmental practices. We strive to provide our clients with key information like dress codes, local language and customs regarding the destinations. Orientation programs to educate our trekking support crew on environmental conservation and its importance are undertaken periodically. This trip has been designed in a way that it can be done by any age group without any prior experience in adventure.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Group size<br />\r\n	The size of the group could vary from 2 - 16 people. Though we can manage larger groups due to group dynamics we only operate groups up to 16 people. We have limited number of people in all our departures to ensure personalized service. We try and make sure that the need of each and every client is attended to and he/she feels comfortable and can enjoy the amazing culture, landscape and people better and have a great holiday.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Access<br />\r\n	Darjeeling is connected to the rest of the country by air, train and road.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	BY AIR &ndash; Major airlines operate direct flights from Calcutta and Delhi to Bagdogra airport which is 2 hours drive from Darjeeling.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	BY TRAIN &ndash; New Jalpaiguri, 2 hours from Darjeeling, is connected to the major cities of India. Several trains operate between the major cities of India and New Jalpaiguri.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	BY ROAD &ndash; Siliguri, the major hub in the plains is well connected to the rest of India by road. It is a 2 hour scenic drive through tea gardens and forests to Darjeeling.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Documentation&nbsp;<br />\r\n	An Indian Visa is required to visit Darjeeling. It can be obtained in the Indian Embassy or in the consulates. For this trek we need a permit for Singalila National Park. We will acquire this upon arrival in Manebhanjyang.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Currency<br />\r\n	The currency in India is the Indian Rupee (Rs), which is divided into 100 paisa (p). Bills are available in 10, 20, 50,100 and 500 denominations. Travellers&rsquo; Cheques can be changed at banks in the cities but not necessarily elsewhere, although some hotels and travel agents are licensed to change money. US dollars in cash are not widely accepted so it is prudent to change your money into rupees before embarking on a trip. Your guide will be able to advise on where to change money. You will need your passport when you change money.&nbsp; Credit cards are accepted in hotels and shops catering to tourists. Credit cards are also useful as an emergency source of cash as there are a lot of automated teller machines in the major cities and towns and the major cities from where money can withdrawn. You may well be approached by people offering black market currency exchange &ndash; this is of course illegal, and hard currency gained in this way often contributes to criminal activities.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	What to Take<br />\r\n	Clothing and Footwear<br />\r\n	Warm down jacket for the cold<br />\r\n	Warm clothes<br />\r\n	Spare clothing - several thinner layers are better than one thick layer<br />\r\n	&nbsp;Walking boots - well worn-in, with good ankle support and strong ridged soles with good tread<br />\r\n	Trekking boots<br />\r\n	Windproof/waterproof trousers and jacket with hood, good rain gear<br />\r\n	Sun protection: sunglasses with UV protection<br />\r\n	Loop-pile socks - one thick and one thin pair reduces the risk of blisters<br />\r\n	Long trousers and long-sleeved shirts<br />\r\n	Sun hat<br />\r\n	Comfortable clothes - for evenings and comfortable shoes for sightseeing<br />\r\n	A small rucksack - a bin liner will keep contents dry if it rains<br />\r\n	Balaclava/ warm Cap<br />\r\n	Scarf/ mask<br />\r\n	Windbreakers/ Jacket<br />\r\n	Down Sleeping bag<br />\r\n	Flashlight&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Sturdy water bottle&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Moisturizing lotion<br />\r\n	Full length Thermarest pad &nbsp;<br />\r\n	Large duffel bag<br />\r\n	Lip balm<br />\r\n	Sunscreen<br />\r\n	Hydration bladder with drinking tube&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Pocket knife.

So taking care in what you eat or drink is the best bet. Travelling in India does not involve major health risks providing simple precautions are observed. Drink only bottled water or boiled, filtered and treated water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added. Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually unpasteurised; do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene &ndash; wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water.&nbsp; Please remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential in avoiding illness.&nbsp; Despite these precautions, the change of climate, water and diet may still cause some minor stomach upset, and you should obtain a suitable drug such as Immodium or Lomotil from your pharmacist to take with you.&nbsp; If you can, obtain suppositories, as they are obviously easier to use if you are feeling or being sick.&nbsp; Remember however that these drugs provide relief from the symptoms but don&rsquo;t cure the problem and should not be used if you are dehydrated &ndash; the main treatment is to drink plenty of fluids: weak black tea with a little sugar and diluted fizzy drinks left to go flat are recommended. You should also take a rehydration solution such as Dioralyte in case of severe problems, and don&rsquo;t eat rich or spicy food as you recover.&nbsp; Previous guests have recommended taking a hot water bottle (an aluminium water bottle can serve a dual purpose such as this), which can be a great comfort to an upset stomach.&nbsp; Thoroughly cooked food is the safest bet but not if it has been left to cool. Stomach upsets are the most likely travel health problem but the majority of these upsets are relatively minor. Wash your hands frequently as it&#39;s quite easy to contaminate your own food. You should clean your teeth with purified water rather than straight from the tap. Avoid climatic extremes. Keep out of the sun when it is hot, dress warmly when it is cold. Avoid potential diseases by dressing sensibly. You can get worm infections through bare feet. Try to avoid insect bites by covering bare skin when insects are around, by screening windows or by using insect repellents.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Altitude Sickness<br />\r\n	Sometimes travelers face health hazards mainly due to the high altitude. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as loss of appetite, fatigue, headache, nausea, dizziness, palpitations, sleeplessness, breathlessness. The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Safety&nbsp;<br />\r\n	We have been successfully organizing treks since the inception of the company. Safety is number one priority for us. This itinerary has been meticulously planned and designed with years of experience and know - how. Thorough planning, good logistical coordination and support of experienced staff ensure that our clients enjoy the trip to the utmost. Our support staff is also well equipped with communication devices so that they can get help should a situation an emergency situation arise.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Immunisations<br />\r\n	Immunisations currently recommended for India are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid.&nbsp; Typhoid may be given in two separate injections so you will need to consult your doctor in plenty of time.&nbsp; A vaccination is available for cholera but most doctors no longer consider this worth giving as it has a low success rate and tourists are unlikely to become infected if basic hygiene is observed. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk.&nbsp; Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary. You should also ensure that your Tetanus and Polio injections are up-to-date.&nbsp; The situation with regard to vaccinations and health precautions is subject to change, and you should consult your doctor for advice as early as possible.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Physical Fitness<br />\r\n	Since the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare your self by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\n	&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Medical Facilities<br />\r\n	There are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in India.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Insurance<br />\r\n	All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Time Zones&nbsp;<br />\r\n	India is 5 hours 30 minutes ahead of GMT.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Drinking Water<br />\r\n	While on trek we serve boiled and filtered clean bacteria free water everyday.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Food on the trek<br />\r\n	Food on this trek is based on the best available food in the lodges. Our support crew will also carry some extra food with them to serve you on the trip.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Support Crew<br />\r\n	The support comprises of a qualified tour leader, sirdar, sherpas and porters. All our staff are locals who are experts in their field. They are well trained and experienced to handle clients&#39; individual needs. Their knowledge on local culture and customs makes your trip an extra exciting. All our Tour Leaders have undergone leadership training and have had intensive courses on mountain medicine, first aid and are capable of handling emergency situations. They are deep understanding and knowledge of the mountain culture and are familiar with high altitude survival skills. Our support crew (except the porters) are usually sherpas who have been the backbone of the tourism industry in these parts and the team usually has years of experience between them and so our team is prepared for all eventualities in the mountains. The preservation of the fragile Eco system is of utmost importance to us and our support staff is made well aware of the significance of preserving the environment. We conduct regular orientation programs to educate our support crew regarding the importance of conservation of our environment. We take pride in the high quality of service we render &ndash; personalized, professional and above all enjoyable. Our crew with a keen sense of hospitality will make your holiday worthwhile. You will make friends with our tour leader during the trip and find adventure that you will re-live the rest of your life.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Best Season<br />\r\n	It is best to visit this region in spring and autumn. Spring generally begins in March and ends in May. Though there is a slight haze the forests covered with a riot of scarlet coloured rhododendrons, primulas, daisies, white magnolias and a host of other beautiful plants making a trek an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Mid September heralds the beginning of the autumn season. Mid September to mid November enjoys excellent climate coupled with deep blue sky and clear days making this period the best trekking period of the year.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Accommodation<br />\r\n	We use the tourist class hotels with homely ambience available throughout the trip. They give you an insight into the local culture. The accommodation is based on full board basis throughout except Calcutta.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	During the trek the accommodation is totally based on homes of the local people so that we can experience the local culture and savour local cuisines. The homes are clean and often also double as a restaurant and lodges for the tourists during the tourist season. We will provide the best possible accommodation en route. However please note that the accommodation in this area are not as good as one would expect in the cities as tourism has not yet developed into a full fledged economic activity in this region.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Transportation<br />\r\n	Driving is on the left in India but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. Comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group. For groups up to 8 people we use Tata Sumo and Mahindra Maxx Jeeps and for bigger groups we use, Tata Tempo, and coaches.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://atalante-nepal.com/programs/itinerary/373885226929.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Detailed Itinerary &raquo;</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trip Code</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AT16DJ01</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Destination</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://atalante-nepal.com/destinations.php?ID=5\">Darjeeling India</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duration</p>\r\n\r\n<p>15 Days</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Activity</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://atalante-nepal.com/adventures.php?ID=1\">Treks</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trek Type</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tea House</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dates</p>\r\n\r\n<p>26 Feb 2017<br />\r\n12 Mar 2017<br />\r\n09 Apr 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guaranteed Departure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mimimum 2 pax</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trip Grade: Easy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are soft treks that introduce you to what trekking is all about.

The bustling city of Calcutta serves as a gateway for our journey. Here we take a trip down memory lane and relive history as we travel through Dalhousie Square, the epicenter of British power in India until the transfer of its capital to Delhi. The majestic landmarks, many of which symbolize the rich legacy of Calcutta like the Victoria Memorial are architectural gems we visit. We then fly to Bagdogra and drive through undulating hills covered with lush green tea gardens and enjoy the fresh aroma of tea as it whiffs through the air. We follow the railway tracks of the celebrated &nbsp;&ldquo;Toy Train&rsquo; and stop to marvel at some of the loops and crossings which are examples of the engineering brilliance of its builders. We savour one of the most expensive teas in the world in the comfort of a colonial bungalow in Kurseong. Next morning we take a joy ride on the famous toy train and visit an agricultural project that is bringing about a quiet revolution in agriculture and education. The project advocates and promotes self sustenance and environment friendly agricultural practices and uses the proceeds from the products for the education of the local people. We then trek through thick forests of pine trees and visit an organic farm that grows vegetables in a green house environment throughout the year. Here we visit several schools built during the late 1800s and early 1900 and enjoy the colonial flavour that still linger in these institutions. We then travel to Darjeeling. Spread over a hill Darjeeling affords one of the most beautiful views of the Kanchenjunga massif. The sprawling tea gardens, the Victorian edifices, the Mall and the Toy Train exude colonial charm and take us back into time. We enjoy a stunning view of the sunrise, ride the toy train, and soak ourselves in the hospitality of yesteryears in a colonial villa. Darjeeling is synonymous with tea and to complete the experience of the British Raj we head to Glenburn Tea Estate and spend two nights in the comfort of a European Bungalow and experience how the British Tea Planters lived. Here spend two absorbing days in the company of one of the oldest tea producing families in India and learn what goes into making Darjeeling tea from the bush to our cup. We then experience the cultural wonders of Sikkim where we visit one of the most important Buddhist Monasteries in the world. In Kalimpong we walk among tree tops, experience the edifices that exude the colonial charm of this quaint town. We then wind up our trip with a visit to Agra, the city of Taj Mahal, one of the most remarkable structures built on this earth. All the accommodations are in hotels that complete the British Raj experience. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n','<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Responsible Travel</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile. Responsible and sustainable tourism has always been our main thrust and mantra so that the environment and its resources- natural or cultural &ndash; always remain intact for the future generations to savor. We strongly advise that all non-biodegradable items such as can, bottles, batteries, plastics etc to be brought back to Darjeeling for proper disposition. We discourage the use of bottled mineral water to control the plastic waste. Since water is essential while traveling we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers. As a part of our responsible tourism drive we use local guides and locally owned hotels (wherever possible) so that the people can earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility. We are always adding new destinations and in the process working with local communities to forge a partnership to ensure change for the local people as well as visitors. &nbsp;Our tour programs are designed to work closely with the people and the environment of the destination so that the visitors can feel it to be an integral part of their holiday experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This heritage tour is tailor-made to give you have a deeper understanding of the local culture and heritage. We visit various sites that are normally off the regular tourist map to generate more awareness regarding these places so that they are preserved for the coming generations to savour. We have designed this trip in the way that can be done by any age group without any prior experience in adventure. Anyone with and spirit of adventure to explore the exotic can enjoy the thrills of this trip. We encourage interaction between our clients and the locals through home or school visit, teaching local dance and dialects so that the clients have a better understanding of the countries they are visiting. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Group size</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The size of the group could vary from 2 - 16 people. Though we can manage larger groups due to group dynamics we only operate groups up to 16 people. We have limited number of people in all our departures to ensure personalized service. We try and make sure that the need of each and every client is attended to and he/she feels comfortable and can enjoy the amazing culture, landscape and people better and have a great holiday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Staff on the trip</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Orientation programs to educate our support crew on environmental conservation and its importance are undertaken periodically. We provide opportunities for local people to earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility. With years of experience, research and suggestions of experts and clients, this trip has been put together with utmost consideration of our clients&#39; expectations, comfort and safety. All our staff is highly qualified in their field and we provide the best service and equipments for our clients&#39; satisfaction, comfort and safety. Their knowledge on local culture and customs makes your trip an extra exciting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Access</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Darjeeling Kalimpong and Sikkim is connected to the rest of the country by air, train and road.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">BY AIR &ndash; Major airlines operate direct flights from Calcutta and Delhi to Bagdogra airport which is 2 hours drive from Darjeeling and Kalimpong and 3 and half hours from Gangtok.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A regular helicopter service operated between Sikkim and Bagdogra.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">BY TRAIN &ndash; New Jalpaiguri, 2 hours from Darjeeling and Kalimpong and 3 and half hours from Gangtok, is connected to the major cities of India. Several trains operate between the major cities of India and New Jalpaiguri.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">BY ROAD &ndash; Siliguri, the major hub in the plains is well connected to the rest of India by road. It is a 2 hour scenic drive through tea gardens and forests to Darjeeling and Kalimpong and 3 and half hours to Gangtok.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Documentation&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">An Indian Visa is required to visit Darjeeling and Sikkim. It can be obtained in the Indian Embassy or in the consulates. To visit Sikkim a special permit called the Inner Line Permit (ILP) is required. The Inner Line Permit can be obtained while acquiring the Indian Visa at the Indian Embassy or Consulate or upon arrival at Siliguri, Darjeeling and Rangpo. Two passport size photos are needed for acquiring the ILP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Currency</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The currency in India is the Indian Rupee (Rs). &nbsp;Bills are available in 10, 20, 50,100,500 denominations. Travellers&rsquo; Cheques can be changed at banks in the cities but not necessarily elsewhere, although some hotels and travel agents are licensed to change money. US dollars in cash are not widely accepted so it is prudent to change your money into rupees before embarking on a trip. Your guide will be able to advise on where to change money. You will need your passport when you change money. &nbsp;Credit cards are accepted in hotels and shops catering to tourists. &nbsp;Credit cards are also useful as an emergency source of cash as there are a lot of automated teller machines in the major cities and towns and the major cities from where money can withdrawn. You may well be approached by people offering black market currency exchange &ndash; this is of course illegal, and hard currency gained in this way often contributes to criminal activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">What to Take</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Clothing and Footwear</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Warm down jacket for the cold</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Warm clothes</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Spare clothing - several thinner layers are better than one thick layer</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The weather in Darjeeling/ Sikkim can vary significantly, and the best advice is to take clothing that will layer to cover all eventualities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Walking boots/ shoes - well worn-in, with good ankle support and strong ridged soles with good tread, and spare laces</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Windproof/waterproof trousers and jacket with hood, good rain gear: It is quite likely to rain at some point whilst you are out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Sunglasses&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Loop-pile socks - one thick and one thin pair reduces the risk of blisters</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Long trousers and long-sleeved shirts&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Sun hat</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Comfortable clothes - for evenings and comfortable shoes for sightseeing</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Lightweight survival bag</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- A small rucksack - a bin liner will keep contents dry if it rains</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Windbreakers/ Jacket</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Down Sleeping bag</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Towel&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Torch&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">-money belt; fold-up bag for souvenirs; camera and plenty of spare film; umbrella</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Water bottle: with at least 1 litre capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Moisturizing lotion</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Insect repellent</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Medical Kit</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">We provide a first aid kit with medication for altitude sickness, nausea, dehydration, pain killers, and medication for dysentery, diarrhea, bandages, water purifier, antiseptic creams, throat lozenges, eye drops, antibiotics, nasal sprays, and pain relievers in tubes or spray but it is advisable to carry some medication on you without taking too much room in your baggage. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">However we recommend the clients to carry the following items:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Asprin or Panadol - for pain or fever</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Antihistamine - useful as a decongestant for colds, allergies, to ease the itch from insect bites and stings or to help prevent motion sickness</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Antibiotics-useful if you are traveling well off the beaten track but they must be prescribed</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Kaolin preparation (Pepto-Bismol), Imodium or Lomotil - for stomach upsets and to stop diarrhea and dehydration</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Antiseptic, Mercurochrome and Antibiotic powder or similar &#39;dry&#39; spray-for cuts and grazes</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Calamine lotion-to ease irritation from bites and stings</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Bandages and band-aids- for minor injuries and wounds</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Scissors, Tweezers and a Thermometer</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Throat Lozenges&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Acetaminophen (paracetamol)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Antacid tablets</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Health</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Prevention is always the best cure. So taking care in what you eat or drink is the best bet. Travelling in India does not involve major health risks providing simple precautions are observed. Drink only bottled water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added. Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually unpasteurised; do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene &ndash; wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water. &nbsp;Please remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential in avoiding illness. &nbsp;Despite these precautions, the change of climate, water and diet may still cause some minor stomach upset, and you should obtain a suitable drug such as Immodium or Lomotil from your pharmacist to take with you. &nbsp;If you can, obtain suppositories, as they are obviously easier to use if you are feeling or being sick. &nbsp;Remember however that these drugs provide relief from the symptoms but don&rsquo;t cure the problem and should not be used if you are dehydrated &ndash; the main treatment is to drink plenty of fluids: weak black tea with a little sugar and diluted fizzy drinks left to go flat are recommended. You should also take a rehydration solution such as Dioralyte in case of severe problems, and don&rsquo;t eat rich or spicy food as you recover. &nbsp;Previous guests have recommended taking a hot water bottle (an aluminium water bottle can serve a dual purpose such as this), which can be a great comfort to an upset stomach. &nbsp;Thoroughly cooked food is the safest bet but not if it has been left to cool. Stomach upsets are the most likely travel health problem but the majority of these upsets are relatively minor. Wash your hands frequently as it&#39;s quite easy to contaminate your own food. You should clean your teeth with purified water rather than straight from the tap. Avoid climatic extremes. Keep out of the sun when it is hot, dress warmly when it is cold. Avoid potential diseases by dressing sensibly. You can get worm infections through bare feet. Try to avoid insect bites by covering bare skin when insects are around, by screening windows or by using insect repellents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Immunisations</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Immunisations currently recommended for India are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. &nbsp;Typhoid may be given in two separate injections so you will need to consult your doctor in plenty of time. &nbsp;A vaccination is available for cholera but most doctors no longer consider this worth giving as it has a low success rate and tourists are unlikely to become infected if basic hygiene is observed. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. &nbsp;You should also ensure that your Tetanus and Polio injections are up-to-date. &nbsp;The situation with regard to vaccinations and health precautions is subject to change, and you should consult your doctor for advice as early as possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Medical Facilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">There are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Insurance</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Time Zones&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">India is 5 hours 30 minutes ahead of GMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Best Season</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It is best to visit this region in spring and autumn. Spring generally begins in March and ends in May. Though there is a slight haze the forests covered with a riot of scarlet coloured rhododendrons, primulas, daisies, white magnolias and a host of other beautiful plants making the visit an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Mid September heralds the beginning of the autumn season. Mid September to mid November enjoys excellent climate coupled with deep blue sky and clear days making this period the period of the year to visit this area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Accommodation</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">We use the tourist class hotels with homely ambience available throughout the trip, They give you an insight into the local culture. The accommodation is based on full board basis throughout except Calcutta and Delhi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Transportation</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Driving is on the left in India but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. Comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group. For groups up to 8 people we use Scorpio, Tavera, Toyota Qualis, Ford Endeavour and Toyota Innova. For bigger groups we use, Tata Tempo, regular and deluxe coaches depending upon the category of the group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Risk and Liability&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Our trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times. However sometimes unforeseen circumstances like landslides, floods, bad weather, bad road condition, vehicle breakdown, delay in flights due to bad weather, local political situation could contribute to the change in the program.

All extra expenses (apart from the services offered as per the program) that occur in such cases would have to borne directly by the clients themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Days</th>\r\n			<th>Activity</th>\r\n			<th>Accomodation</th>\r\n			<th>Meals</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 1</td>\r\n			<td>Late night arrival in Calcutta</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 2</td>\r\n			<td>Full day sigtseeing in Calcutta</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>B</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 3</td>\r\n			<td>Fly Kolkata to Bagdogra, drive to Kurseong</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 4</td>\r\n			<td>Full day sightseeing, evening transfer to Darjeeling</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 5</td>\r\n			<td>Full day sightseeing in Darjeeling</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 6</td>\r\n			<td>Drive to Glenburn tea Estate, evening walk</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 7</td>\r\n			<td>Full day visit of Glenburn factory</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 8</td>\r\n			<td>Drive to Martam, afternoon excursion around</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 9</td>\r\n			<td>Drive to Gangtok, visit Rumtek en route</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 10</td>\r\n			<td>Half day sightseeing, transfer to Kalimpong</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 11</td>\r\n			<td>Full day excursion to Lave and Lolaygaon</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>BLD</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 12</td>\r\n			<td>Drive to Bagdogra and fly to Delhi</td>\r\n			<td>Hotel</td>\r\n			<td>B</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Day 13</td>\r\n			<td>Drive to Agra, sightseeing, evening transfer to Delhi and departure</td>\r\n			<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n			<td>B</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n','<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Group Size</th>\r\n			<th>Cost Per Person</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>2 - 4 Pax</td>\r\n			<td>$2095</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>5 - 8 Pax</td>\r\n			<td>$1860</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>9 - 12 Pax</td>\r\n			<td>$1795</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>12 Pax and above</td>\r\n			<td>$1750</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Single tent/room supplement</td>\r\n			<td>$250</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cost Includes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>2 nights at Hotel in Calcutta on BB basis&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>All transfers as per program</li>\r\n	<li>Sightseeing with cultural guide as per program</li>\r\n	<li>All entrance fees as per program</li>\r\n	<li>1 night at Hotel in Kurseong on twin sharing and full board basis</li>\r\n	<li>2 nights at Hotel in Darjeeling on twin sharing and full board basis</li>\r\n	<li>2 nights at Glenburn Tea Estate (with all activities ) on twin sharing and full board basis</li>\r\n	<li>1 night Hotel in Gangtok on twin sharing and full board basis</li>\r\n	<li>1 night in Martam on twin sharing and full board basis</li>\r\n	<li>2 nights Hotel in Kalimpong on twin sharing and full board basis</li>\r\n	<li>1 English speaking guide and escort throughout the trip</li>\r\n	<li>1 night accommodation in Delhi on twin sharing and BB basis&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Train in chair class for Delhi - Agra&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cost Excludes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>International Airfare</li>\r\n	<li>Visa fees for India</li>\r\n	<li>Airfare Calcutta - Bagdogra</li>\r\n	<li>Airfare Bagdogra - Delhi</li>\r\n	<li>Airport transfer in Delhi</li>\r\n	<li>Laundry, bottled drinks and beverages</li>\r\n	<li>Telephone medical kit, tips, personal natured expenses</li>\r\n	<li>Personal travel insurance including rescue and evacuation,</li>\r\n	<li>Extra expenses incurred due to unforeseen circumstances</li>\r\n	<li>Lunch and dinner in Calcutta, Delhi and Agra&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Room for wash and change in Delhi</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n','','2016-12-26 15:42:17','admin','2017-07-18 05:46:52','admin'),

The crew could surprise you with cakes, pies and pizza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Support staff</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All our Tour Leaders have undergone leadership training and have had intensive courses on mountain medicine, first aid and are capable of handling emergency situations. They are deep understanding and knowledge of the mountain culture and are familiar with high altitude survival skills. Our support crew (except the porters) are usually sherpas who have been the backbone of the trekking industry in Nepal and the team usually has years of experience between them and so our team is prepared for all eventualities in the mountains. &nbsp;The preservation of the fragile Eco system is of utmost importance to us and our support staff is made well aware of the significance of preserving the environment. We conduct regular orientation programs to educate our support crew regarding the importance of conservation of our environment.

You will make friends with our tour leader during the trip and find adventure that you will re-live the rest of your life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best Season</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most appropriate time to visit Upper Dolpo is between May &ndash; September. The sky is clear and the climate is mild with temperatures suitable for travel. &nbsp;Since Upper Dolpo lies in the rain shadow area it is unaffected by the monsoons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trek Equipment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For camping treks we provide state of the art equipment that comprises of two men North Face Tents, Mess tent, Kitchen tent, Toilet tent, Shower tents, folding chairs, tables, cooking utensils, fuel (kerosene or LPG), all cooking appliances, mattresses, shower pumps, folding toilet seats and gamow bags in case of high altitude treks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transportation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driving is on the left in Nepal but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. Comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photography</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole world uses digital photography these days. The sunlight is very bright during the daytime due to the thin air so please take that into account while filming. Not all of the monasteries and places of interest are open for filming. Some places levy a small amount for every picture taken while in some places it is strictly prohibited so it is advisable to seek the advice of your guide before you take a photo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Group size</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The size of the group could vary from 2 - 16 people. Though we can manage larger groups due to group dynamics we only operate groups up to 16 people. We have limited number of people in all our departures to ensure personalized service. We try and make sure that the need of each and every client is attended to and he/she feels comfortable and can enjoy the amazing culture, landscape and people better and have a great holiday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responsible Tourism</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile. Responsible and sustainable tourism has always been our main thrust and mantra so that the environment and its resources- natural or cultural &ndash; always remain intact for the future generations to savor. We strongly advise that all non-biodegradable items such as can, bottles, batteries, plastics etc to be brought back to Kathmandu for proper disposition. We discourage the use of bottled mineral water to control the plastic bottles&#39; waste. Since water is essential while traveling at such high altitudes we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers. As a part of our responsible tourism drive we use local guides and locally owned hotels (wherever possible) so that the people can earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Packing List</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weather in Nepal can vary significantly, and the best advice is to take clothing that will layer to cover all eventualities.

So take care in what you eat or drink. Travelling in Nepal does not involve major health risks provided simple precautions are observed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Drink bottled water.

Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Loss of appetite</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Fatigue</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Headache</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Nausea</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Dizziness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Palpitations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Sleeplessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Breathlessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaccination</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Physical fitness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare yourself by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical Facilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance. You will need to leave your insurance details in our office in Kathmandu during the trip so that we can make necessary arrangements should the need arise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk and Liability&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times.

The crew could surprise you with cakes, pies and pizza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Support staff</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All our Tour Leaders have undergone leadership training and have had intensive courses on mountain medicine, first aid and are capable of handling emergency situations. They are deep understanding and knowledge of the mountain culture and are familiar with high altitude survival skills. Our support crew (except the porters) are usually sherpas who have been the backbone of the trekking industry in Nepal and the team usually has years of experience between them and so our team is prepared for all eventualities in the mountains. &nbsp;The preservation of the fragile Eco system is of utmost importance to us and our support staff is made well aware of the significance of preserving the environment.

Though there is a slight haze the forests covered with a riot of scarlet coloured rhododendrons, primulas, daisies, white magnolias and a host of other beautiful plants making a trek an exhilarating experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Mid September heralds the beginning of the autumn season. Mid September to mid November enjoys excellent climate coupled with deep blue sky and clear days making this period the best trekking period of the year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trek Equipment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For camping treks we provide state of the art equipment that comprises of two men North Face Tents, Mess tent, Kitchen tent, Toilet tent, Shower tents, folding chairs, tables, cooking utensils, fuel (kerosene or LPG), all cooking appliances, mattresses, shower pumps, folding toilet seats and gamow bags in case of high altitude treks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transportation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driving is on the left in Nepal but your vehicle may be a left-hand drive, meaning you alight into the traffic &ndash; please take care. Comfortable jeeps, vans or tourist coaches will be provided for all transportation depending on the size of the group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photography</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole world uses digital photography these days. The sunlight is very bright during the daytime due to the thin air so please take that into account while filming. Not all of the monasteries and places of interest are open for filming. Some places levy a small amount for every picture taken while in some places it is strictly prohibited so it is advisable to seek the advice of your guide before you take a photo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Group size</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The size of the group could vary from 2 - 16 people.

We try and make sure that the need of each and every client is attended to and he/she feels comfortable and can enjoy the amazing culture, landscape and people better and have a great holiday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responsible Tourism</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ecology of the Himalayas is very fragile. Responsible and sustainable tourism has always been our main thrust and mantra so that the environment and its resources- natural or cultural &ndash; always remain intact for the future generations to savor. We strongly advise that all non-biodegradable items such as can, bottles, batteries, plastics etc to be brought back to Kathmandu for proper disposition. We discourage the use of bottled mineral water to control the plastic bottles&#39; waste. Since water is essential while traveling at such high altitudes we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers. As a part of our responsible tourism drive we use local guides and locally owned hotels (wherever possible) so that the people can earn income from direct employment or through the distribution of work responsibility.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Packing List</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weather in Nepal can vary significantly, and the best advice is to take clothing that will layer to cover all eventualities.

So take care in what you eat or drink. Travelling in Nepal does not involve major health risks provided simple precautions are observed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Drink bottled water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually unpasteurized</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential to avoid illnesses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Altitude sickness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes travelers face health hazards mainly due to the high altitude. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Loss of appetite</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Fatigue</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Headache</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Nausea</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Dizziness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Palpitations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Sleeplessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Breathlessness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaccination</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Physical fitness</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare yourself by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical Facilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance. You will need to leave your insurance details in our office in Kathmandu during the trip so that we can make necessary arrangements should the need arise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk and Liability&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times.

So take care in what you eat or drink. Travelling in Nepal does not involve major health risks provided simple precautions are observed.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Drink bottled water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually unpasteurized<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential to avoid illnesses.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAltitude sickness<br />\r\nSometimes travelers face health hazards mainly due to the high altitude. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Loss of appetite<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fatigue<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Headache<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nausea<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dizziness<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Palpitations<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sleeplessness<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Breathlessness<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVaccination<br />\r\nImmunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhysical fitness<br />\r\nSince the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare yourself by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMedical Facilities<br />\r\nThere are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInsurance<br />\r\nInsurance All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance. You will need to leave your insurance details in our office in Kathmandu during the trip so that we can make necessary arrangements should the need arise.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRisk and Liability&nbsp;<br />\r\nOur trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times. However sometimes unforeseen circumstances like landslides, floods, bad weather, bad road condition, vehicle breakdown, delay in flights due to bad weather, local political situation could contribute to the change in the program.

Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Loss of appetite<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fatigue<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Headache<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nausea<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dizziness<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Palpitations<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sleeplessness<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Breathlessness<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVaccination<br />\r\nImmunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhysical fitness<br />\r\nSince the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health.

So take care in what you eat or drink. Travelling in Nepal does not involve major health risks provided simple precautions are observed.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Drink bottled water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually unpasteurized<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential to avoid illnesses.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAltitude sickness<br />\r\nSometimes travelers face health hazards mainly due to the high altitude. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Loss of appetite<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fatigue<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Headache<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nausea<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dizziness<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Palpitations<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sleeplessness<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Breathlessness<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVaccination<br />\r\nImmunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhysical fitness<br />\r\nSince the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare yourself by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMedical Facilities<br />\r\nThere are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInsurance<br />\r\nInsurance All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance. You will need to leave your insurance details in our office in Kathmandu during the trip so that we can make necessary arrangements should the need arise.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRisk and Liability&nbsp;<br />\r\nOur trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times. However sometimes unforeseen circumstances like landslides, floods, bad weather, bad road condition, vehicle breakdown, delay in flights due to bad weather, local political situation could contribute to the change in the program.

Since water is essential while traveling at such high altitudes we advise our clients to carry sturdy water bottles so that they can fill them up with hot water that is treated with water purifiers.

Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Loss of appetite<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fatigue<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Headache<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nausea<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dizziness<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Palpitations<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sleeplessness<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Breathlessness<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need.

It may easily be cold in the evenings and when walking at higher altitudes.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Clothing and Footwear<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Warm down jacket for the cold&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Warm clothes&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Spare clothing - several thinner layers are better than one thick layer&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Walking boots - well worn-in, with good ankle support and strong ridged soles with good tread, and spare boot laces<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Trekking boots - Windproof/waterproof trousers and jacket with hood, good rain gear: It is quite likely to rain at some point whilst you are out.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sun protection: sunglasses with UV protection<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Loop-pile socks - one thick and one thin pair reduces the risk of blisters<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Long trousers and long-sleeved shirts to provide protection from the sun&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sun hat - although it is unlikely to be too hot, the sun may be very strong<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Comfortable clothes - for evenings and comfortable shoes for sightseeing&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lightweight survival bag - A small rucksack - a bin liner will keep contents dry if it rains<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Balaclava/ warm Cap - Scarf/ mask<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Windbreakers/ Jacket&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Down Sleeping bag&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Towel - if you intend to go swimming and for use on the trek (bath towels are of course supplied in hotels)&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Torch - essential as not everywhere has electricity and the mains supply can be erratic<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Adapter - sockets may be large or small, 3 round pin or 2 round pin.

So take care in what you eat or drink. Travelling in Nepal does not involve major health risks provided simple precautions are observed.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Drink bottled water. Reputable brands of bottled water or soft drinks are generally fine. Take care with fruit juice, particularly if water may have been added.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do not take ice; be wary of uncooked food including salads, fruit juice and ice-cream; remember that milk is usually unpasteurized<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do not bathe in freshwater rivers and lakes, and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wash your hands frequently and clean your teeth with bottled water.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease remember to pay attention to sensible hygiene at all times and to follow any advice given by your guide &ndash; it is essential to avoid illnesses.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAltitude sickness<br />\r\nSometimes travelers face health hazards mainly due to the high altitude. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a frequent problem in the Himalayan region and can affect a traveler is various ways irrespective of their age, gender or health fitness. Even if you are in perfect health and peak fitness, you can still develop AMS. Previous experience of high places, pre-ascent training and good physical shape do not prevent the onset of altitude sickness - it can strike anyone of any age. Our body normally time to be acclimated to the high altitude. The body undergoes a number of physiological changes some of which are increased pulse and respiratory rate. Others appear slowly over a period of weeks like the change in acid base balance and production of extra red blood cells. These changes and the effect of intense sunlight, strenuous walks and dehydration may cause some mild or vague symptoms such as:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Loss of appetite<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fatigue<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Headache<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nausea<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dizziness<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Palpitations<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sleeplessness<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Breathlessness<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;The condition is caused by lower than normal levels of oxygen being absorbed. If the sickness is acute, you can become confused, irrational and mentally unbalanced. The best way to counter it is prevention. You should not exert yourself or walk too fast. Drinking plenty of liquid, eating well and watching for warning sign is highly advised. Aside from following your guide&#39;s advice, you can try to eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates to build up glycogen in the muscles, avoid unnecessary vigorous activity in addition to the trek or climb and do not ascend faster than you need. Keep physical activity to the minimum and take regular doses of diamox as directed by your physician. IF the symptoms do not recede then do not hesitate to talk with our staff. Our trekking teams carry a Gamow bag (a portable compression chamber) to be used in severe cases. If you have a history of respiratory and heart problem please consult your physician before embarking on this trip. But based on our years of experience, with proper preparation and time taken to acclimatize, severe cases are relatively rare. Though we will ensure that you are safe and at worst will suffer only the mildest of symptoms it is best to listen to your body; no-one knows it better than you!&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVaccination<br />\r\nImmunisations currently recommended for Nepal are those for Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Ensure also that you apply insect repellent liberally and do not expose bare skin to mosquitoes after dusk. Meningitis is a risk in certain areas of Nepal at certain times of year and you should consult your doctor as to whether immunisation is necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhysical fitness<br />\r\nSince the above trip entails traveling at high altitude it is necessary that the client is in good health. Before you embark on any one of these trips it is advisable to be physically and mentally fit and prepared. Prepare yourself by jogging or walking at least one hour daily for a minimum period of one month. A thorough health check up is strongly recommended before the trip.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMedical Facilities<br />\r\nThere are many pharmacies which sells medicines and some have a doctor&rsquo;s clinic. Prescription is not a requirement for purchase of harmless drugs in Nepal.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInsurance<br />\r\nInsurance All the clients are strongly advised to have personal travel insurance covering trip cancellations or interruptions due to natural disasters or medical reasons, insurance against emergency evacuation, medical and accident insurance. You will need to leave your insurance details in our office in Kathmandu during the trip so that we can make necessary arrangements should the need arise.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRisk and Liability&nbsp;<br />\r\nOur trips mean safety, reliability and the professional personnel to ensure your convenience at all times. However sometimes unforeseen circumstances like landslides, floods, bad weather, bad road condition, vehicle breakdown, delay in flights due to bad weather, local political situation could contribute to the change in the program. No claim of refund will be entertained including early return from the trip, or change in itinerary due to unavoidable situations like the above. All extra expenses (apart from the services offered as per the program) that occur in such cases would have to borne directly by the clients themselves.</p>\r\n','<p>Day&nbsp;1&nbsp;Drive Kathmandu - Borderlands or The Last Resort (1170) 4 hrs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day&nbsp;2&nbsp;The Last Resort/Borderlands (1170 m) - Listi (2260 m) 5 hrs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day&nbsp;3&nbsp;Listi (2260 m) - Shotang Kharka (3379 m) 7 hrs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day&nbsp;4&nbsp;Shotang Kharka (3379 m) - Chogomogor Kharka (3925 m) 5-6 hrs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day&nbsp;5&nbsp;Chogomogor Kharka (3925 m) - Kyansin (2520 m) 5 hrs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day&nbsp;6&nbsp;Kyansin (2520 m) - Tembathang (2160 m) 5 hrs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day&nbsp;7&nbsp;Tembathang (2160 m) - Chedupa Kharka (2513 m) 7 hrs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day&nbsp;8&nbsp;Chedupa Kharka (2513 m) - Nemagchukpa kharka (3578 m) 5 hrs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day&nbsp;9&nbsp;Nemagchukpa kharka (3578 m) - Panch Pokhari (4074 m) 5 hrs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day&nbsp;10&nbsp;Panch Pokhari (4074 m).

The majority of Thamel hotels have not yet had government engineers surveys but they are open for business as normal. When considering a hotel choice please look for the &lsquo;Green Sticker&rsquo;, the official survey stamp that the building is safe.

Many restaurants are closing early (9pm) but only because there is so little trade</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Does the phone and Internet work?</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">All communication systems work as you would normally expect.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Is there lawless behavior like looting?</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">NO! &nbsp;Never happened.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Is there a likelihood of aftershocks during my visit?</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Nepal has always had earthquakes, on average it gets over twenty per year, many under 4 magnitude so there always have been tremors. These are now happening in a very short and mostly gentle form on a regular basis however most people are not even aware of them happening.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">What health precautions need to be taken?</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Use only bottled mineral water or boiled and filtered water only. Always wash your hands before eating. Do not eat unpeeled fruits or vegetables unless they have been thoroughly washed.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">If I need to see a doctor, where can I do so?</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">There are well-equipped general and specialized hospitals, nursing homes and private clinics manned by very competitive doctors in Kathmandu, Pokhara and other cities if you fall sick. Your hotel will provide good advice on the matter</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">What is Acute Mountain Sickness and how do you prevent it?</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is caused by thin air at high altitudes starting from 3, 000 meters upwards and may even lead to death. The main precaution that needs to be taken while trekking is not to go up too high too fast. So the body should be given enough time to acclimatize.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">If you suffer from initial symptoms like headaches, shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, inability to sleep, swelling of the face, hands and feet and loss of appetite, descend to a lower elevation immediately, and seek medical help.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Are there clinics to treat AMS on trekking routes?</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">The Himalayan Rescue Association (HRA), a non-profit organization that works to prevent casualties from AMS, operates a permanent aid post in Manang which is managed by volunteer doctors from HRA. It also operates a small aid post in the Khumbu village of Pheriche at 4,280 m during the trekking season by volunteer doctors. HRA also operates a camp at Everest Base Camp during the mountaineering season.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">For more information,</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Contact: 01-4440293</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Is travel insurance necessary to go trekking in Nepal?</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">Helicopter services are available should you fall sick or meet with an accident while trekking.

Eighty percent of all the rain in Nepal&nbsp;is received during the monsoon (June-September). Winter rains are more pronounced in the western hills. The average annual rainfall is 1,600 mm, but it varies by eco-climatic zones, such as 3,345 mm in Pokhara and below 300 mm in Mustang.</span></span></span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"color:#696969\"><span style=\"font-family:times new roman,times,serif\">There is no seasonal constraint on traveling in and through Nepal.

As with most of the trekking areas in Nepal, the best time to visit are during spring and autumn.

He leads various groups in climbs throughout the world mainly in the Andes, Alaska, the Atlas and the Himalayan peaks where he has climbed and trekked extensively. He has several successful ascents to his credit including Cho Oyu, Gasherbrum II and Mount Everest, all without bottled oxygen and unassisted, making him the first Portuguese to achieve this feat. He has been accorded several awards and has published many books on mountaineering, the most prominent among them being &ldquo;A Mais Alta Solid&atilde;o&rdquo;, which is already in its 7th edition.
